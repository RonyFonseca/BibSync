ABSTRACT = {The effect of COVID-19 lockdown (LD) on many ambient air pollutants (NO, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, O3 and SO2) was assessed for the first time in the Western Balkans with an innovative approach that evaluates a variety of factors including the stringency of the LD measures, the type of location, the pollution sources, the correlation with traffic fluxes and the meteorology. To that end, observations from 10 urban sites were compared with historical time series. The time window 1 February–30 May 2020 was classified in sub-periods on the basis of the stringency of the circulation restrictions. NO2 and O3 are the pollutants most affected by restrictions to population circulation due to lockdown during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are well correlated with traffic fluxes. A reduction in fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) concentrations is observed in all sites only during the full LD periods, while the relation between SO2 average and maximum hourly concentrations and LD periods in industrial and traffic sites vary from site to site. The reduction in NO2 concentrations during the LD resulted in a reduction in mortality associated with air pollution in the largest cities, while the interpretation of the changes in O3 and particulate matter is less clear.},

ABSTRACT = {The motivation for this research stems from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), specifically SDGs 7, 11, 12, and 13, which focus on the mitigation of climate change and sustainable economic development. This study examined the impact of renewable energy use, institutional quality, and production expansion on consumption-based carbon dioxide (CCO2) emissions in BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) from 1996 to 2020. To achieve this, we applied advanced econometric techniques, including second-generation cointegration and unit root tests, along with the novel panel method of moments quantile regression (MMQR). The Westerlund cointegration test confirmed the presence of a long-run co-movement among renewable energy usage, economic growth, institutional quality, and environmental quality, suggesting a stable equilibrium relationship between these variables. The results from MMQR reveal that GDP has a positive and statistically significant effect on CCO2 emissions across all quantiles, indicating that economic expansion contributes to environmental degradation. In contrast, renewable energy consumption and institutional quality show negative and significant impacts on CCO2 emissions, indicating their mitigating effect on environmental deterioration. As a robustness check, the findings from fixed-effect OLS (FE-OLS), generalized method of moments (GMM), and common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) estimations broadly confirm the results of MMQR. These findings underscore the importance of renewable energy consumption and strong institutional frameworks in promoting environmental sustainability.},

ABSTRACT = {Clouds play a key role in the Earth’s radiation budget, weather, and hydrological cycle, as well as the radiative and thermodynamic components of the climate system. Spaceborne observations are an essential tool to detect clouds, study cloud–radiation interactions, and explore their microphysical properties. Recent advancements in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions of satellite-borne measurements and the increasing variety of orbits and observing geometries offer the opportunity for more efficient and sophisticated retrieval procedures, leading to the more accurate estimation of cloud parameters. However, despite the availability of near-coincident observations of the same atmospheric state, the synergy between the whole set of acquired information is still largely underexplored. The use of synergy is often invoked to optimize the exploitation of the available information, but it is rarely implemented. Indeed, the strategy currently used in most cases is that retrievals are performed separately for each instrument and, only later, the retrieved products are combined. In this framework, therefore, there is a strong need to study and exploit the synergy potential of the instruments currently in orbit or that will be put in orbit in the next few years. This paper reviews the efforts already made in this direction, combining passive infrared and microwave to retrieve cloud microphysical properties. We provide readers with a framework to interpret the state of the art, highlighting the pros and cons of the various approaches currently used with a look to the most promising methodologies to be deployed to address the challenges of this field.},

ABSTRACT = {This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the vertical accuracy of ERA5 reanalysis data for boundary layer height and key meteorological variables, based on high-precision observational data from Baotou, located on the Mongolian Plateau, during the winter (January–March) and summer (July–August) months of 2021. Results indicate that ERA5 exhibits significant biases in horizontal wind speed, with deviations ranging from −5 to 8 m/s at 50 m, primarily driven by sandstorms in winter and convective weather in summer. The most pronounced errors occur below 500 m. Vertical wind speeds are consistently underestimated in both seasons, with biases reaching up to 1 m/s, particularly during active summer convection. ERA5 also struggles to reproduce low-level wind directions accurately. In winter, correlation coefficients range from 0.43 to 0.64 below 200 m and improve to above 0.7 at 500 m. In summer, correlation coefficients are lower, ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 below 200 m, with reduced accuracy at 500 m compared to winter. Temperature deviations increase above 2000 m, with a relative overestimation of 3% at 3000 m. Relative humidity is generally overestimated by 5–20% between 1000 and 2000 m in winter and by 10–30% in summer. For boundary layer heights, ERA5 overestimates daytime mixed-layer heights by up to 2000 m in summer and 500–800 m in winter. In contrast, ERA5 captures nocturnal stable boundary layer heights well during winter. This comprehensive evaluation of the vertical structure accuracy of ERA5 reanalysis data, conducted in a heavily industrialized city on the Mongolian Plateau, offers essential insights for improving meteorological studies and refining climate models in the region. The findings provide valuable reference data for enhancing weather forecasting and supporting climate change research, particularly in complex terrain areas.},

ABSTRACT = {This study explores the predictability of monthly asthma notifications using models built from different machine learning techniques in Maceió, a municipality with a tropical climate located in the northeast of Brazil. Two sets of predictors were combined and tested, the first containing meteorological variables and pollutants, called exp1, and the second only meteorological variables, called exp2. For both experiments, tests were also carried out incorporating lagged information from the time series of asthma records. The models were trained on 80% of the data and validated on the remaining 20%. Among the five methods evaluated—random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN)—the RF models showed superior performance, notably those of exp1 when incorporating lagged asthma notifications as an additional predictor. Minimum temperature and sulfur dioxide emerged as key variables, probably due to their associations with respiratory health and pollution levels, emphasizing their role in asthma exacerbation. The autocorrelation of the residuals was assessed due to the inclusion of lagged variables in some experiments. The results highlight the importance of pollutant and meteorological factors in predicting asthma cases, with implications for public health monitoring. Despite the limitations presented and discussed, this study demonstrates that forecast accuracy improves when a wider range of lagged variables are used, and indicates the suitability of RF for health datasets with complex time series.},

ABSTRACT = {The Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon, combined with reduced vegetation and heat generated by human activities, presents a major environmental challenge for many European urban areas. The UHI effect is especially concerning in hot and temperate climates, like the Mediterranean region, during the summer months as it intensifies the discomfort and raises the risk of heat-related health issues. As a result, assessing urban heat dynamics and steering sustainable land management practices is becoming increasingly crucial. Analyzing the relationship between land cover and Land Surface Temperature (LST) can significantly contribute to achieving this objective. This study evaluates the spatial correlations between various land cover types and LST trends in Thessaloniki, Greece, using data from the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) program and advanced vegetation index techniques within Google Earth Engine (GEE). Our analysis revealed that there has been a gradual increase in average surface temperature over the past five years, with a more pronounced increase observed in the last two years (2022 and 2023) with mean annual LST values reaching 26.07 °C and 27.09 °C, respectively. By employing indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and performing correlation analysis, we further analyzed the influence of diverse urban landscapes on LST distribution across different land use categories over the study area, contributing to a deeper understanding of UHI effects.},

ABSTRACT = {Climate change is significantly altering Ethiopia’s weather patterns, causing substantial shifts in temperature and precipitation extremes. This study examines historical trends and changes in extreme rainfall and temperature, as well as seasonal rainfall variability across Ethiopia. In this study, we employed the Mann–Kendall test, Sen’s slope estimator, and empirical orthogonal function (EOF), with data from 103 stations (1994–2023). The findings provide insights into 16 climate extremes of temperature and precipitation by utilizing the climpact2.GUI tool in R software (v1.2). The study found statistical increases were observed in 59.22% of the annual maximum value of daily maximum temperature (TXx) and 77.67% of the annual maximum value of daily minimum temperature (TNx). Conversely, decreasing trends were found in 51.46% of the annual maximum daily maximum temperature (TXn) and 85.44% of the diurnal temperature range (DTR). The results of extreme precipitation found that 72.82% of yearly total precipitation (PRCPTOT), 73.79% of consecutive wet days (CWD), and 54.37% of the number of heavy precipitation days (R10mm) showed increasing trends. In contrast, at most selected stations, 61.17% of consecutive dry days (CDD), 55.34% of maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1day), 56.31% of maximum 5-day precipitation (RX5day), 66.02% of precipitation from very wet days (R95p), and 52.43% of precipitation from extremely wet days (R99p) were decreasing. The results of seasonal precipitation variability during Ethiopia’s JJAS (Kiremt) season found that the first three EOF modes accounted for 59.78% of the variability. Notably, EOF1, which accounted for 35.84% of this variability, showed declining rainfall patterns, particularly in northwestern and central-western Ethiopia. The findings of this study will help policymakers and stakeholders understand these changes and take necessary action, as well as build effective adaptation and mitigation measures in the face of climate change impacts.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing global adoption of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources has transformed the use of forecasting, scenario planning, and other techniques for managing their inherent generation uncertainty and interdependencies. What were once desirable enhancements are now fundamental requirements. This is more prominent in Brazil, given the large hydro capacity that has been installed. Given the need to understand the interdependencies within variable renewable energy systems, copula-based techniques are receiving increasing consideration. The objective is to explore and model the correlation and complementarity, based on the copula approach, evaluating the potential of this methodology considering a case test composed of hydro, wind, and solar assets. The proposed framework simulated joint scenarios for monthly natural energy (streamflows transformed into energy), wind speed and solar radiation, applied to a small case test, considering historical data from the Brazilian energy system. The results demonstrate that simulated scenarios are validated by their ability to replicate key statistical attributes of the historical record, as well as the interplay and complementarity among hydrology, wind speed, and solar radiation.},

ABSTRACT = {Wildfires in the United States have increased in frequency and severity over recent decades, driven by climate change, altered weather patterns, and accumulated flammable materials. Accurately forecasting the Fire Weather Index (FWI) is crucial for mitigating wildfire risks and protecting ecosystems, human health, and infrastructure. This study analyzed FWI trends across the Continental United States (CONUS) from 2014 to 2023, using meteorological data from the gridMET dataset. Key variables, including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, were utilized to calculate the FWI at a fine spatial resolution of 4 km, ensuring the precise identification of wildfire-prone areas. Based on this, our study developed a hybrid modeling framework to forecast FWI over a 14-day horizon, integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TCNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Autoregressive Networks (DeepAR). The models were evaluated using the Index of Agreement (IOA) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The results revealed that the Southwest and West regions of CONUS consistently exhibited the highest mean FWI values, with the summer months demonstrating the greatest variability across all climatic zones. In terms of model performance on forecasting, Day 1 results highlighted the superior performance of the GNN-TCNN model, achieving an IOA of 0.95 and an RMSE of 1.21, compared to the GNN-LSTM (IOA: 0.93, RMSE: 1.25) and GNN-DeepAR (IOA: 0.92, RMSE: 1.30). On average, across all 14 days, the GNN-TCNN outperformed others with a mean IOA of 0.885 and an RMSE of 1.325, followed by the GNN-LSTM (IOA: 0.852, RMSE: 1.590) and GNN-DeepAR (IOA: 0.8225, RMSE: 1.755). The GNN-TCNN demonstrated robust accuracy across short-term (days 1–7) and long-term (days 8–14) forecasts. This study advances wildfire risk assessment by combining descriptive analysis with hybrid modeling, offering a scalable and robust framework for FWI forecasting and proactive wildfire management amidst a changing climate.},

ABSTRACT = {Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is sourced by degassing magma in the shallow crust; hence its monitoring provides information on the rates of magma ascent in the feeding conduit and the style and intensity of eruption, ultimately contributing to volcano monitoring and hazard assessment. Here, we present a new algorithm to extract SO2 data from the TROPOMI imaging spectrometer aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, which delivers atmospheric column measurements of sulfur dioxide and other gases with an unprecedented spatial resolution and daily revisit time. Specifically, we automatically extract the volcanic clouds by introducing a two-step approach. Firstly, we used the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering segmentation method, which is an object-based image analysis approach; secondly, the K-means unsupervised machine learning technique is applied to the segmented images, allowing a further and better clustering to distinguish the SO2. We implemented this algorithm in the open-source Google Earth Engine computing platform, which provides TROPOMI imagery collection adjusted in terms of quality parameters. As case studies, we chose three volcanoes: Mount Etna (Italy), Taal (Philippines) and Sangay (Ecuador); we calculated sulfur dioxide mass values from 2018 to date, focusing on a few paroxysmal events. Our results are compared with data available in the literature and with Level 2 TROPOMI imagery, where a mask is provided to identify SO2, finding an optimal agreement. This work paves the way to the release of SO2 flux time series with reduced delay and improved calculation time, hence contributing to a rapid response to volcanic unrest/eruption at volcanoes worldwide.},

ABSTRACT = {Carbon emissions (CE) from expanding construction land (CL), a vital territory for human production and habitation, have contributed to climate change worldwide. The Yellow River Basin (YRB), an essential economic region and energy supply base in China, is experiencing rapid urbanization, and the contradiction between economic development and ecological protection is increasingly acute. Consequently, a thorough examination of the spatial and temporal change features of carbon emissions from construction land (CECL) and its decoupling from economic growth (EG) is crucial for the maintaining development of the region. This study adopts the IPCC carbon emission coefficient approach for measuring the CECL in the YRB from 2010 to 2021. The temporal and spatial variation features of CECL in the YRB were revealed using ArcGIS software and the standard deviation ellipse (SDE) model. The decoupling effect between CECL and EG was analyzed using the Tapio decoupling model and innovatively combined with the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method to explore the influence of five main drivers on the decoupling effect. This study found that: (1) The CECL rose from 2.463 billion tons in 2010 to 3.329 billion tons in 2021. The spatial layout of CECL is “high in the east and low in the west”. (2) The SDE of CECL is distributed in the direction of “northeast to southwest”, and the gravity center’s moving path is “northwest to northeast to northwest”; (3) weak decoupling (WD) is the main decoupling state between CECL and EG; (4) the economic output effect and the construction land (CL) scale effect are the two main factors inhibiting the decoupling of CECL, while the energy intensity effect, the population density effect, and the energy structure effect are the main elements motivating the decoupling of CECL. This study provides specific references and bases for the YRB in China and other countries and regions with similar levels of development in promoting green and ecologically friendly initiatives and achieving low-carbon utilization of regional land and sustainable development.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a systematic review to explore how the Internet of Things (IoT) is empowering the Internet of Pets (IoP) to enhance the quality of life for companion animals. Thirty-six relevant papers published between 2010 and 2024 were retrieved and analyzed following both the PRISMA and the Kitchenham and Charters guidelines for conducting literature reviews. The findings demonstrate that the IoP is transforming pet care by offering innovative solutions for monitoring, feeding, and animal welfare. Asian countries are leading the development of these technologies, with a surge in research activity in recent years (2020–2024). While remote feeding prototypes currently dominate the field (79%), the IoP is anticipated to expand into other areas. Monitoring health (25%), surveillance and monitoring activities (49%), and providing comfort (17%) for pets are the primary research interests. The IoT holds immense potential to improve pet care. Research in this area is expected to continue growing, driving innovation and the creation of new IoP solutions utilizing artificial intelligence to achieve smart and predictive devices. In the future, the development of multifunctional devices that combine various capabilities in a single unit will become commonplace in a society where it is trending for young people to adopt pets instead of having children.},

ABSTRACT = {This study analyzed the correlation between climate indices—El Niño–Southern Oscillation (NINO34), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), Antarctic Oscillation (AOC), Sea Surface Temperature in the southwestern Atlantic (ISSTRG2 + RG3), South Atlantic Subtropical High (SASH), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO)—and precipitation in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) during 45-day subseasonal periods from 2006 to 2022. Precipitation data from 670 rain gauges were categorized into three clusters: cluster 1, located in western RS, displayed the lowest precipitation variation; cluster 2, in eastern RS, exhibited the greatest variability; and cluster 3, situated in northern RS. ENSO demonstrated the strongest positive correlation with precipitation during spring in clusters 1 and 3 (0.65–0.79), while PDO also correlated positively, especially in summer and spring. AOC exhibited negative correlations, most pronounced in spring. Significant inter-index correlations were identified, including a high positive correlation between SASH and AOC (0.7) and a high negative correlation between NINO34 and SOI (−0.73). Within clusters, NINO34 and PDO showed low positive correlations with precipitation (0.24–0.32), while SOI demonstrated low negative correlations (−0.21 to −0.30). Seasonal analysis revealed that NINO34 influenced summer and spring precipitation, correlating with above-average rainfall during El Niño events. SASH and PDO also showed positive correlations with summer and spring rainfall, with PDO’s positive phase associated with a 25% increase in precipitation. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between global climatic indices and regional precipitation patterns, enhancing the understanding of subseasonal climate variability in RS and supporting the development of more accurate climate prediction models for the region.},

ABSTRACT = {Nature-based solutions (NBS) encompass a diverse range of ecosystem-based strategies aimed at addressing urban sustainability challenges. Among these, skyscraper greenery emerges as a specialized application of NBS, integrating vertical vegetation systems into high-rise architecture to enhance carbon sequestration, mitigate urban heat islands, and improve air quality. By extending NBS principles into the vertical dimension of cities, this approach offers a scalable solution for climate adaptation in high-density urban environments. This study provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of skyscraper greenery research from 2003 to 2023, employing advanced tools such as CiteSpace and Bibliometrix to assess publication trends, elucidate key research themes, and identify prevailing knowledge gaps. The findings underscore the environmental benefits of skyscraper greenery, including its role in alleviating the urban heat island effect, improving air quality, and enhancing urban biodiversity. Additionally, economic advantages, such as reductions in energy consumption and operational costs, further highlight its multifaceted utility. Carbon sequestration within skyscraper greenery primarily occurs through vegetation’s photosynthetic processes, which are influenced by plant species, substrate composition, and system design. Thermal performance, ecosystem services, and biodiversity emerge as pivotal themes driving research in this domain. However, the field faces persistent challenges, including inconsistent methodologies for measuring carbon sequestration, a lack of technical standards, and limited public awareness. Future studies must prioritize the standardization of carbon measurement protocols, optimization of plant and substrate selection, and integration of skyscraper greenery within comprehensive urban sustainability frameworks. Addressing socio-economic barriers and enhancing policy incentives will be essential for widespread adoption. This review emphasizes the transformative potential of skyscraper greenery as a multifunctional strategy for climate mitigation, advancing resilient, low-carbon, and sustainable urban environments.},

Many methods, including machine learning methods, have been developed for ET partitioning. However, the applicability of machine learning models in cropland ET partitioning with diverse crop rotations is not clear. In this study, machine learning models are used to predict E, and T is obtained by calculating the difference between ET and E, leading to the derivation of the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration (T/ET). We evaluated six machine learning models (i.e., artificial neural networks (ANN), extremely randomized trees (ExtraTrees), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) on partitioning ET at 16 cropland flux sites during the period from 2000 to 2020. The evaluation results showed that the XGBoost model had the best performance (R = 0.88, RMSE = 6.87 W/m2, NSE = 0.77, and MAE = 3.41 W/m2) when considering the meteorological data, ecosystem sensible heat flux, ecosystem respiration, soil water content, and remote sensing vegetation indices as input variables. Due to the unavailability of observed E or T data at the 16 cropland sites, we used three other widely used ET partitioning methods to indirectly validate the accuracy of our ET partitioning results based on XGBoost. The results showed that our T estimation results were highly consistent with their T estimation results (R = 0.83–0.91). Moreover, based on the XGBoost model and the three other ET partitioning methods, we estimated the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration (T/ET) for different crops. On average, maize had the highest T/ET of 0.619 ± 0.119, followed by soybean (0.618 ± 0.085), winter wheat (0.614 ± 0.08), and sugar beet (0.611 ± 0.065). Lower T/ET was found for paddy rice (0.505 ± 0.055), winter barley (0.590 ± 0.058), potato (0.540 ± 0.088), and rapeseed (0.522 ± 0.107). These results suggest the machine learning models are easy and applicable for cropland T/ET estimation with different crop rotations and reveal obvious differences in water use among different crops, which is crucial for the sustainability of water resources and improvements in cropland water use efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {Kazakhstan’s pasture, as a spatially extended agricultural resource for sustainable animal husbandry, requires effective monitoring with connected rational uses. Ranking number nine globally in terms of land size, Kazakhstan, with an area of about three million square km, requires proper assessment technologies for climate change and anthropogenic impact to track the pasture lands’ degradation. Remote sensing (RS)-based adaptive approaches for assessing pasture load, combined with field cross-checking of pastures, have been applied to evaluate the quality of vegetation cover, economic potential, service function, regenerative capacity, pasture productivity, and changes in plant species composition for five pilot regions in Kazakhstan. The current stages of these efforts are presented in this project report. The pasture lands in five regions, including Pavlodar (8,340,064 ha), North Kazakhstan (2,871,248 ha), Akmola (5,783,503 ha), Kostanay (11,762,318 ha), Karaganda (19,709,128 ha), and Ulytau (18,260,865 ha), were evaluated. Combined RS data were processed and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Vegetation Cover (FCover), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC), and Canopy Water Content (CWC) indices were determined, in relation to the herbage of pastures and their growth and development, for field biophysical analysis. The highest values of LAI, FCOVER, and FARAR were recorded in the Akmola region, with index values of 18.5, 126.42, and 53.9, and the North Kazakhstan region, with index values of 17.89, 143.45, and 57.91, respectively. The massive 2024 spring floods, which occurred in the Akmola, North Kazakhstan, Kostanay, and Karaganda regions, caused many problems, particularly to civil constructions and buildings; however, these same floods had a very positive impact on pasture areas as they increased soil moisture. Further detailed investigations are ongoing to update the flood zones, wetlands, and swamp areas. The mapping of proper flood zones is required in Kazakhstan for pasture activities, rather than civil building construction. The related sustainable permissible grazing husbandry pasture loads are required to develop also. Recommendations for these preparation efforts are in the works.},

ABSTRACT = {This study introduces an adaptive robust approach for optimally sizing hybrid renewable energy systems (HRESs) comprising solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and a diesel generator. It integrates vector auto-regressive models (VAR) and neural networks (NN) into dynamic uncertainty sets (DUSs) to address temporal auto-correlations and cross-correlations among uncertain parameters like energy demand and solar and wind energy supply. These DUSs are compared to static and independent dynamic uncertainty sets based on time series (TS) from the literature. An exact iterative algorithm is developed to solve the problem effectively. A case study of a northern Ontario community evaluates the proposed framework and the solution method using real test data. Simulation reveals a 10.7% increase in capital cost on average but a 36.2% decrease in operational cost, resulting in a 16.4% total cost reduction and an 8.1% improvement in system reliability compared to the nominal model employing point estimates. Furthermore, the proposed VAR- and NN-based DUSs significantly outperform classical static and TS-based dynamic sets, underscoring the necessity of considering cross-correlations in uncertainty quantification.},

ABSTRACT = {The Antarctic sea ice concentration (SIC) plays a crucial role in global climate dynamics by influencing atmospheric and oceanic circulation. This study examines SIC variability and its relationship with major climate modes, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific-South American (PSA) pattern, Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and Antarctic Dipole (ADP). Using NSIDC satellite-derived sea ice data and ERA5 reanalysis from 1980 to 2022, we analyzed SIC anomalies in the Weddell, Ross, and Bellingshausen and Amundsen (B&A) Seas, assessing their response to climatic forcings across different timescales. Our findings reveal strong linkages between SIC variability and large-scale atmospheric circulation. ENSO-related teleconnections drive a dipolar SIC response, with warming in the Pacific sector and cooling in the Atlantic during El Niño, and the opposite pattern during La Niña. PSA and ADP further modulate this response by altering Rossby wave propagation and heat fluxes, leading to significant SIC fluctuations. The ADP emerges as a dominant driver of interannual SIC anomalies, showing an out-of-phase relationship between the Atlantic and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean. Regional SIC trends exhibit contrasting patterns: the Ross Sea shows a significant positive SIC trend, while the B&A and Weddell Seas experience persistent negative anomalies due to enhanced meridional heat transport and stronger westerly winds. SAM strongly influences SIC, particularly in the Atlantic sector, with delayed responses of up to six months, likely due to ice-albedo feedbacks and ocean memory effects. These results enhance our understanding of Antarctic sea ice variability and its sensitivity to large-scale climate oscillations. Given the observed trends and ongoing climate change, further research is needed to assess how these processes will evolve under future warming scenarios. This study highlights the importance of continuous satellite observations and high-resolution climate modeling for improving projections of Antarctic sea ice behavior and its implications for the global climate system.},

ABSTRACT = {This research applies continuous wavelet analysis and seasonal correlation analysis to tree-ring data from Três Barras National Forest (FLONA Três Barras), revealing diverse influences on growth, including climate, solar activity, and external factors. The methodology involved tree-ring collection and subsequent wavelet and seasonal analyses to unveil the non-stationary characteristics of and multifaceted influences on growth. Key findings include the subtle effects of El Niño events on tree-ring development, the sensitivity of Araucaria angustifolia to temperature changes, the significant influence of precipitation during drought periods, and the intricate relationship between tree growth and solar cycles. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) emerges as a primary climatic driver during specific intervals, with external factors (precipitation, temperature, and solar cycle–solar irradiance) influencing tree response between 1936 and 1989. Additionally, the seasonal correlation analysis highlighted the importance of sub-annual climate variability, capturing specific intervals, such as a 3-month season ending in March of the previous year, that significantly impacted tree-ring growth. The study underscores the importance of protecting the endangered Araucaria angustifolia for climatic studies and local communities. Historically, in Brazil, Araucaria angustifolia seeds played a vital role in sustaining indigenous populations, which in turn helped to disperse and propagate forests, creating anthropogenic landscapes that highlight the interconnected relationship between humans and the preservation of these forests.},

ABSTRACT = {This work introduces a model for lead-acid battery health monitoring in automobiles, focusing on detecting degradation before complete failure. With the proliferation of electronic modules and increasing power demands in vehicles, along with enhanced sensor data availability, this study aims to investigate battery lifespan. Dead batteries often lead to customer dissatisfaction and additional expenses due to inadequate diagnosis. This study seeks to enhance predictive diagnostics and provide drivers with timely warnings about battery health. The proposed method employs the Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis Coefficient for end-of-life detection by analyzing the cross-correlation of voltage signals from batteries in different states of health. The results demonstrate that batteries with a good state of health exhibit a coefficient consistently within the statistically significant cross-correlation zone across all time scales, indicating a strong correlation with reference batteries over extended time scales. In contrast, batteries with a deteriorated state of health compute a coefficient below 0.3, often falling within the non-significant cross-correlation zone, confirming a clear decline in correlation. The method effectively distinguishes batteries nearing the end of their useful life, offering a low-computational-cost alternative for real-time battery monitoring in automotive applications.},

ABSTRACT = {This study addresses the challenge of estimating reference crop evapotranspiration (ETO) in Xizang Plateau irrigation districts with limited meteorological data by proposing a coupled LASSO-BP model that integrates LASSO regression with a BP neural network. The model was applied to three irrigation districts: Moda (MD), Jiangbei (JB), and Manla (ML). Using ETO values calculated by the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (FAO-56PM) model as a benchmark, the performance and applicability of the LASSO-BP model were assessed. Short-term ETO predictions for the three districts were also conducted using the mean-generating function optimal subset regression algorithm. The results revealed significant multicollinearity among six meteorological factors (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, average relative humidity, sunshine duration, and average wind speed), as identified through tolerance, variance inflation factor (VIF), and eigenvalue analysis. The LASSO-BP model effectively captured the interannual variation of ETO, accurately identifying peaks and troughs, with trends closely aligned with the FAO-56PM model. The model demonstrated strong performance across all three districts, with evaluation metrics showing MAE, RMSE, NSE, and R2 values ranging from 4.26 to 9.48 mm·a−1, 5.91 to 11.78 mm·a−1, 0.92 to 0.96, and 0.82 to 0.94, respectively. Prediction results indicated a statistically insignificant declining trend in annual ETO across the three districts over the study period. Overall, the LASSO-BP model is a reliable and accurate tool for estimating ETO in Xizang Plateau irrigation districts with limited meteorological data.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrology relates to many complex challenges due to climate variability, limited resources, and especially, increased demands on sustainable management of water and soil. Conventional approaches often cannot respond to the integrated complexity and continuous change inherent in the water system; hence, researchers have explored advanced data-driven solutions. This review paper revisits how artificial intelligence (AI) is dramatically changing the most important facets of hydrological research, including soil and land surface modeling, streamflow, groundwater forecasting, water quality assessment, and remote sensing applications in water resources. In soil and land modeling, AI techniques could further enhance accuracy in soil texture analysis, moisture estimation, and erosion prediction for better land management. Advanced AI models could also be used as a tool to forecast streamflow and groundwater levels, therefore providing valuable lead times for flood preparedness and water resource planning in transboundary basins. In water quality, AI-driven methods improve contamination risk assessment, enable the detection of anomalies, and track pollutants to assist in water treatment processes and regulatory practices. AI techniques combined with remote sensing open new perspectives on monitoring water resources at a spatial scale, from flood forecasting to groundwater storage variations. This paper’s synthesis emphasizes AI’s immense potential in hydrology; it also covers the latest advances and future prospects of the field to ensure sustainable water and soil management.},

ABSTRACT = {Plastic waste poses a significant challenge in Africa and around the world, with its volume continuing to increase at an alarming rate. In Africa, an estimated 25–33% of daily waste is made up of plastic, posing a threat to the environment, marine life, and human health. One potential solution to this problem is waste-to-energy recycling, such as pyrolysis, which involves the conversion of waste materials into oil, char, and non-condensable gasses through a thermochemical process in the absence of oxygen. Given the abundance of waste in Africa and the continent’s energy challenges, pyrolysis offers a sustainable solution. This review delves into the concept of pyrolysis, its products, thermodynamics, and endothermic kinetics, presenting it as a promising way to address the plastic waste problem in Africa. Despite the African Union’s goal to recycle plastic waste, the continent faces significant barriers in achieving this target, including infrastructural, economic, and social difficulties. It is crucial to implement sustainable strategies for managing plastic waste in Africa to mitigate environmental degradation and promote a cleaner and healthier living environment. Pyrolysis technology is highlighted as a viable solution for plastic waste management, as it can convert plastic waste into valuable byproducts such as oil, char, and syngas. Case studies from countries like South Africa and Nigeria demonstrate the potential for scaling up pyrolysis to address waste management issues while generating energy and job opportunities. This review underscores the need for investment, regulatory support, and public awareness to overcome the challenges and unlock the full potential of pyrolysis in Africa. Embracing pyrolysis as a method for managing plastic waste could lead to significant environmental and economic benefits for the continent.},

ABSTRACT = {Soybeans are key in generating foreign currency for the world economy. Geotechnologies, through vegetation indices (VIs) generated by orbital images or remotely piloted aircraft, are essential tools for assessing the impact of climate on productivity and the ecoclimatic suitability of crops. This study aimed to correlate the growth indices from the CLIMEX model, previously validated, with VIs derived from orbital remote sensing and ecological niche modeling for soybean cultivation in six irrigated pivots located in the northwest of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVImax) and the maximum soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVImax) were extracted from Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS sensor images for the 2016 to 2019 harvests during the R1 to R3 phenological stages. The maximum NDVI values varied across the study regions and crops, ranging from 0.27 to 0.95. Similarly, SAVI values exhibited variability, with the maximum SAVI ranging from 0.13 to 0.85. The growth index (GIw), derived from the CLIMEX model, ranged from 0.88 to 1. The statistical analysis confirmed a significant correlation (p < 0.05) between NDVImax and GIw only for the 2018/19 harvest, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.86, classified as very strong. Across all harvests, NDVI consistently outperformed SAVI in correlation strength with GIw. Using geotechnologies through remote sensing shows promise for correlating spectral indices and climate suitability models. However, when using a valid model, all crops did not correlate. Still, our study has the potential to be improved by investigating new hypotheses, such as using drone images with better resolution (spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric) and adjusting the response of soybean vegetation indices and the phenological stage. Our results correlating the CLIMEX model of growth indices with vegetation indices have the potential for monitoring soybean cultivation and analyzing the performance of varieties but require a more in-depth view to adapt the methodology.},

ABSTRACT = {With global climate challenges intensifying, the cement industry, as a major CO2 emitter, has attracted significant attention regarding its emission reduction potential and strategies. Advanced economies like the European Union use carbon pricing to spur innovation, while emerging countries focus on incremental solutions, such as fuel substitution. Combining LMDI decomposition and the LEAP model, this study examines Jiangsu Province as a test bed for China’s decarbonization strategy, a highly efficient region with carbon intensity 8% lower than the national average. Historical analysis identifies carbon intensity, energy mix, energy intensity, output scale, and economic effects as key drivers of emission changes. Specifically, the reduction in cement production, real estate contraction, lower housing construction, and reduced production capacity are the main factors curbing emissions. Under an integrated technology strategy—including energy efficiency, fuel and clinker substitution, and CCS—CO2 emissions from Jiangsu’s cement sector are projected to decrease to 17.28 million tons and 10.9 million tons by 2060 under high- and low-demand scenarios, respectively. Clinker substitution is the most significant CO2 reduction technology, contributing about 60%, while energy efficiency gains contribute only 3.4%. Despite the full deployment of existing reduction methods, Jiangsu’s cement industry is expected to face an emissions gap of approximately 10 million tons to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, highlighting the need for innovative emission reduction technologies or carbon trading to meet carbon neutrality goals.},

ABSTRACT = {Air quality is predominantly influenced by two factors: emission sources and meteorological conditions. Understanding their relative contribution is essential for developing effective air pollution control strategies. Two rounds of lockdown measures in Lanzhou during the winter of 2021 and 2022 offered a valuable opportunity to reveal the impact of pollutant emissions and meteorological conditions on air pollution events. The reduction in emissions during the pandemic lockdown period (2021–2022) resulted in a 36.05% decrease in PM2.5 concentrations compared to the historical period of 2014–2020. Using ERA5 reanalysis meteorological data and principal component analysis, weather patterns were classified into three distinct types: favorable for pollutant accumulation (FPA), unfavorable for pollutant accumulation (NFP), and neutral condition (NTL). A comparative analysis of pollutant concentrations, frequency, and duration of each weather type during the lockdown and historical periods revealed that weather types had a minimal impact on pollutant levels, with emissions serving as the dominant factor. Nevertheless, the occurrence of FPA was often linked to severe pollution events, suggesting a positive feedback loop between severe pollution and FPA weather type. This indicated that FPA can lead to severe pollution events and more severe pollution may be associated with prolonged FPA durations. These findings suggest that identifying FPA weather patterns can significantly inform the implementation of air pollution control measures to mitigate air pollution levels.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate solar radiation data are crucial for solar energy applications, yet ground-based measurements are limited in many regions. Satellite-derived and reanalysis products offer an alternative, but their accuracy varies across spatial and temporal scales. This study evaluated the performance of four widely used GHI products—CAMS, SARAH-3, ERA5 and MERRA-2—against ground measurements at hourly, daily (summed from hourly) and monthly (averaged from daily) timescales. The analysis also examined how temporal aggregation influenced error characteristics using correlation coefficients, the rMBD, the rRMSD and the combined performance index (CPI). At an hourly scale under clear-sky conditions, satellite products outperformed reanalysis products, with r≈1 and R2≈0.9 and the rMBD, rRMSD and CPI ranging from 0.1%, 11.4% and 11.8% to −14.7%, 33.3% and 75.1% for CAMS; 0.2%, 11.4% and 10.9% to 13.5%, 22.4% and 120.7% for SARAH-3; −0.2%, 21.6% and 23.8% to 21.5%, 40.9% and 128.8% for MERRA-2; and 0.8%, 14.6% and 16.3% to 22%, 48.2% and 88.3% for ERA5. Under cloudy conditions, all products overestimated GHI, with the rMBD reaching up to 39.7% (SARAH-3), 35.9% (CAMS), 22.9% (MERRA-2) and 28% (ERA5), while the rRMSD exceeded 40% for all. Overcast conditions yielded the poorest performance, with the rMBD ranging from 45.8% to 124.6% and the CPI exceeding 800% in some cases. From the hourly to daily and monthly datasets, aggregation reduced errors for reanalysis products by 5.5% and up to 12.4%, respectively, in clear-sky conditions, but for satellite-based products, deviations slightly increased up to 3.1% for the monthly dataset. Under all-sky conditions, all products showed reductions up to 23%. These results highlight the significant challenges in estimating GHI due to limited knowledge of aerosol and cloud dynamics in the region. They emphasize the need for improved parameterization in models and dedicated measurement campaigns to enhance satellite and reanalysis product accuracy in West Africa.},

ABSTRACT = {Project management often overlooks the consideration of long-term effects that may impact sustainability transition and innovation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting an analysis that extends the traditional project life cycle model through the incorporation of a new phase, labelled “system impact”, which integrates innovation and sustainability into project management using a system dynamics methodology. To explore this extension, a simulation model is developed to analyse a solar photovoltaic (PV) power project, providing valuable insights into the systemic and dynamic impacts required for successful project outcomes, including effective benefits management and value creation. The results provide a sustainability-focused assessment of project success. Process innovation efficiency reaches its peak at 140 completed tasks, shortening the project duration from 18 to 13.25 months. This study highlights CO2 emission avoidance over 25 years compared to fossil fuel generators. Economically, despite an initial cost three times higher, the solar PV alternative proves more cost-effective in the long run, amounting to only 19% of the total cost of the fossil fuel option.},

For this purpose, a study of material properties and energy modeling using Building Information Modelling (BIM) is carried out, which helps to evaluate these factors’ energetic and economic implications. Two significant assessments are highlighted, namely active and passive factor analysis and dominant factor analysis. The research studied the architectural design of a one-story house measuring thirty-six square meters outlined by the Ecuadorian Construction Standard (NEC) chapter 15 part 4. A 3D architectural model was generated using Revit 2024 simulation software and subsequently employed to establish an energy model used in Autodesk Insight Software 2024 to assess the factors influencing energy consumption and annual energy expenses. The analysis included a comparison with a model of the house based on the ASHRAE 90.2 standard. The active and passive factors were ranked according to their impact on energy efficiency in the model. The results show that Energy Use Intensity (EUI) has a higher reduction for the ASHRAE model of 4.63%, with 21.60% for the Energy cost. The active factors exhibited a greater impact on the energy performance of the LIH than the passive factors, with the PV-Surface coverage being the factor that generated the highest EUI reduction, with 39.66% and 78.51% for both models. The study concluded by emphasizing the importance of adopting active strategies to achieve energy efficiency and economical house design.},

ABSTRACT = {The integrity of earth infrastructure, encompassing slopes, dams, pavements, and embankments, is fundamental to the functioning of transportation networks, energy systems, and urban development. However, these infrastructures are increasingly threatened by a range of natural and anthropogenic factors. Conventional monitoring techniques, including inclinometers and handheld instruments, often exhibit limitations in spatial coverage and operational efficiency, rendering them insufficient for comprehensive evaluation. In response, Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) have emerged as pivotal technological advancements, offering high-resolution surface characterization and critical subsurface diagnostics, respectively. UAVs facilitate the detection of deformations and geomorphological dynamics, while ERI is instrumental in identifying zones of water saturation and geological structures, detecting groundwater, characterizing vadose zone hydrology, and assessing subsurface soil and rock properties and potential slip surfaces, among others. The integration of these technologies enables multidimensional monitoring capabilities, enhancing the ability to predict and mitigate infrastructure instabilities. This article focuses on recent advancements in the integration of UAVs and ERI through data fusion frameworks, which synthesize surface and subsurface data to support proactive monitoring and predictive analytics. Drawing on a synthesis of contemporary research, this study underscores the potential of these integrative approaches to advance early-warning systems and risk mitigation strategies for critical infrastructure. Furthermore, it identifies existing research gaps and proposes future directions for the development of robust, integrated monitoring methodologies.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing integration of variable renewable energy sources (VRESs) into modern power systems presents significant challenges in ensuring operational flexibility, highlighting the need for robust methodologies to evaluate and ensure system reliability. The Insufficient Ramping Resource Expectation (IRRE) has emerged as a critical metric for quantifying the probability of ramping deficiencies in power systems. However, its traditional application, designed primarily for capacity-constrained systems, may not fully capture the operational dynamics of energy-constrained systems, such as those dominated by hydropower generation. This study analyzes the IRRE methodology and proposes enhancements to incorporate additional constraints, including seasonal and monthly hydrological variability and operational reserve requirements, to better reflect the flexibility limitations in energy-constrained systems. A case study of the Brazilian electricity system evaluates these modifications by comparing traditional and enhanced IRRE results across varying scenarios, including higher VRES penetration. Results reveal that, under stricter constraints, IRRE values increased by over 11 times for monthly hydrological limits in the Northeast subsystem, compared to the traditional IRRE. Additionally, combining these constraints with a 5% operational reserve requirement led to ramping deficits in up to 5% of the hours in a year for the same subsystem, highlighting the critical impact of operational constraints. Furthermore, scenarios with 30% and 100% VRES growth resulted in deficits increasing by 56 times and 418 occurrences, respectively, in certain subsystems. These findings demonstrate the enhanced IRRE’s effectiveness in evaluating flexibility challenges and its relevance for supporting planning and operational strategies in systems undergoing rapid renewable energy expansion.},

ABSTRACT = {Environmental protection and climate change are the most debated issues, both in economic research and in EU legislative regulations. This work is also focused on these issues and aims to analyze the evolution of GHG emissions from transport, the main contributor to total emissions. The novelty of this research aligns with the EU climate policy established within the European Green Deal’s “Fit for 55” package, aiming for a 55% reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels), and the broader objective of climate neutrality by 2050 as outlined in the European Climate Law. The study’s originality lies in the selection of variables that can influence the reduction of emissions and the anticipation of future developments using the Prophet model, for the period 2024–2050. The estimates obtained allowed the construction of clusters to identify EU member states that will record reductions in GHG emissions in the analyzed period and will be able to represent models for other economies. The results obtained are beneficial for decision-makers at European and national levels and highlight the need for urgent action to reduce emissions and limit the negative effects of climate change.},

ABSTRACT = {This research seeks to elucidate the relationship between economic activities, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the economic dimensions of climate change mitigation efforts within the European context, which may be useful for developing policies to mitigate CO2 emissions and promote sustainable development. This study investigates world CO2 emissions and their relation to population growth and finds a strong positive relation based on data from 1969 to 2023. The World Kaya Identity has been applied to understand how changes in the involved factors affect CO2 emissions over time. When studying the more complex relation between the variables by controlling for energy use, GDP, and carbon intensity based on the Kaya Identity, the authors identified an overall long-term coupling of all factors. Considering short-term variations, population growth appears to have an insignificant effect, and carbon intensity appears most influential on CO2 emissions. As a next step, we take a disaggregated view on different country settings, economic sectors, and energy sources to further analyze the role carbon intensity plays for increased CO2 emissions. Here, we lay a special focus on the European perspective. This descriptive analysis lets us draw some general conclusions regarding strategies for reducing the negative impact of CO2 emissions and political efforts for sustainability transformations. This study is important for the current state of science, since a clear economic assessment of the negative effects of carbon dioxide is necessary for planning measures and costs in the ecological sphere, the correct assessment of the impact on the health of the population, the prospective implementation of preventive measures at all levels, and financing measures to reduce the negative effects of carbon dioxide. The authors found a significant positive effect of GDPpc, energy intensity, and carbon intensity on impact and an insignificant effect on the population. Thus, an unexpected increase in the population likely does not have short-term effects on CO2 emissions, and the responses to GDPpc and energy intensity both decrease after some periods, while the shock in carbon intensity shows a significant effect even after 10 years. This is reasonable in the sense that both increases in GDP and energy intensity might be alleviated by technological progress and, thus, only show a short-term positive effect on CO2 emissions. The carbon intensity of energy consumption is more crucial for the long-term change of CO2 emissions. For this reason, we study the decomposition of energy use in more detail by considering descriptive statistics over time and over different sectors and countries.},

ABSTRACT = {Solar radiation is one of the most abundant energy sources in the world and is a crucial parameter that must be researched and developed for the sustainable projects of future generations. This study evaluates the performance of different machine learning methods for solar radiation prediction in Konya, Turkey, a region with high solar energy potential. The analysis is based on hydro-meteorological data collected from NASA/POWER, covering the period from 1 January 1984 to 31 December 2022. The study compares the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU), LSBoost, XGBoost, Bagging, Random Forest (RF), General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (MLANN, RBANN). The hydro-meteorological variables used include temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed, while the target variable is solar radiation. The dataset was divided into 75% for training and 25% for testing. Performance evaluations were conducted using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). The results indicate that LSTM and Bi-LSTM models performed best in the test phase, demonstrating the superiority of deep learning-based approaches for solar radiation prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a spatiotemporal fusion-based evapotranspiration inversion model (OL-SS) for grassland areas on the GEE platform. The model uses the OL processing strategy, with Landsat imagery being used as fine-resolution images and MCD43A4 imagery as coarse-resolution images, combined with GEE’s spatiotemporal fusion technology to generate 30 m resolution images. It then estimates the daily evapotranspiration of grasslands using the constant evaporation ratio method. The model was validated in the Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia, for grassland evapotranspiration inversion during the summer of 2015. The results show the following: 1. the OL-SS model can efficiently generate good spatiotemporal fusion results, but the fusion effect is poorer in some images due to cloud cover; 2. compared with the measured data from flux stations in grassland areas, the evapotranspiration inversion results show a good fit. The model demonstrates strong performance in grassland evapotranspiration monitoring and is suitable for the rapid estimation of daily evapotranspiration in certain grassland regions.},

ABSTRACT = {This study explores the application of Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) to improve the predictability of hourly potential hydropower production for a small run–of–the–river hydropower plant in Portugal. Accurate hourly power forecasts are essential for optimizing participation in the spot electricity market, where deviations incur penalties. This research introduces the novel application of the TFT, a deep–learning model tailored for time series forecasting and uncovering complex patterns, to predict hydropower production based on meteorological data, historical production records, and plant capacity. Key challenges such as filtering observed hydropower outputs (to remove strong, and unpredictable human influence) and adapting the historical series to installed capacity increases are discussed. An analysis of meteorological information from several sources, including ground information, reanalysis, and forecasting models, was also undertaken. Regarding the latter, precipitation forecasts from the European Centre for Medium–Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) proved to be more accurate than those of the Global Forecast System (GFS). When combined with ECMWF data, the TFT model achieved significantly higher accuracy in potential hydropower production predictions. This work provides a framework for integrating advanced machine learning models into operational hydropower scheduling, aiming to reduce classical modeling efforts while maximizing energy production efficiency, reliability, and market performance.},

ABSTRACT = {This study is focused on assessing the impacts of different regional climate model targeted simulations performed at convection-permitting resolution (CPRCM) in the AgS crop model yield simulations, evaluating to what extent climate model uncertainty impacts the modeled yield—considering the spatial and temporal variability of crop yield simulations over central-south Brazil. The ensemble of CPRCMs has been produced as part of a Flagship Pilot Study (FPS-SESA) framework, endorsed by the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The AgS simulated crop yield exhibited significant differences, in both space and time, among the simulations driven by the different CPRCMs as well as when compared with the simulations driven by observations. Rainfall showed the highest uncertainty in CPRCM simulations, particularly in its spatial variability, whereas modeled temperature and solar radiation were generally more accurate and exhibited smaller spatial and temporal differences. The results evidenced the need for multi-model simulations to account for different uncertainty, from different climate models and climate models parameterizations, in crop yield estimations. Inter-institutional collaboration and coordinated science are key aspects to address these end-to-end studies in South America, since there is no single institution able to produce such CPRCM-CropModels ensembles.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding the socioecological nexus between urbanization and ecosystem health (EH) is crucial for formulating sustainable development policies. While prior research has focused on this topic, critical gaps persist in characterizing distributional polarization and decomposing inequality drivers within coupled human–environment systems—particularly in China’s Yellow River Basin (YRB), a strategic region undergoing concurrent ecological restoration and urbanization. The integration of the kernel density estimation and Theil index establishes a robust analytical framework to effectively overcome spatial heterogeneity limitations in regional disparity research. Therefore, this study combines the coupling coordination degree (CCD), nonparametric kernel density estimation, and Theil decomposition to examine the complex interactions between urbanization and the ecosystem health index (EHI) across 538 county-level units from the perspective of spatial heterogeneity. The key findings reveal the following: (1) Urbanization exhibited phased enhancement yet maintained elementary developmental stages overall, with a distinct spatial gradient descending from the eastern/central riparian counties to the western hinterlands. (2) The EHI showed a marginal upward trend, yet 80.29% of the counties persisted in the suboptimal ecological health categories (EHI-1 to EHI-3), with gains concentrated in high-vegetation mountainous areas (45.72%) versus declines in economically developed areas. (3) The CCD evolved from a mild imbalance (II-1) to low coordination (III-1) but with significant special differences—the midstream and downstream CCD improved markedly, while the upstream counties remained the weakest. (4) Intragroup disparities, particularly among the counties in the middle reaches, were the primary drivers of CCD disequilibrium across the YRB, contributing 87.9% to the overall inequality. In contrast, the downstream regions exhibited significant improvements in the coordination levels, accompanied by the emergence of distinct “multi-polarization” patterns. The findings provide refined and differentiated decision-making references for effectively narrowing the gap in coordinated development in the YRB.},

ABSTRACT = {The integration of non-conventional renewable energy sources (NRES) into electricity systems introduces variability and intermittency, challenging power systems traditionally designed for stable and predictable generation. These challenges require policymakers to develop strategies aimed at maintaining reliability, affordability, and sustainability while increasing the share of NRES. One promising solution is leveraging the complementary nature of NRES to mitigate variability. However, the translation of this complementarity into effective policy and incentive structures remains underexplored in existing research. This study addresses this gap by employing system dynamics modeling to analyze the effects of incentivizing complementarity between NRES and electricity system availability. In contrast to traditional methods, which assess complementarity between two or more generation sources, this study evaluates how individual sources complement the system’s availability. The resulting complementarity values are used to guide the design of incentives for new NRES investments. The model is applied to a case study of the Colombian electricity market. The findings suggest that incentivizing complementarity can enhance grid stability, reduce dependence on thermal generation, and lower overall system costs. Future research should refine these metrics to better account for minimum availability and focus on short-term variations to further optimize system flexibility and resilience.},

ABSTRACT = {Greenhouse technologies provide controlled environmental conditions for crop growth, often incorporating automation to enhance productivity. Energy management, which involves monitoring, controlling, and conserving energy, is particularly crucial in northern climates, where greenhouses are among the most energy-intensive sectors of agriculture. This paper presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art greenhouse technologies from an energy management perspective, exploring their role in enhancing efficiency and sustainability. It examines the energy management framework, key technological advancements, benefits, challenges, and available solutions in the market. Furthermore, it discusses principles and methods of energy optimization, best practices for sustainable greenhouse operations, and emerging trends in smart grids, renewable integration, and automation. Unlike previous studies primarily focusing on agricultural and control perspectives, this review highlights new insights into integrating greenhouse energy management with smart grid participation, leveraging model predictive control (MPC) for energy optimization, multi-agent reinforcement learning (DRL) for adaptive control, and digital twin technology for real-time system modeling. By bridging greenhouse energy management with transactive energy platforms, this paper underscores the importance of intelligent, data-driven decision-making in enhancing efficiency, sustainability, and system resilience while minimizing environmental impact.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the impact of data augmentation on predictive maintenance machine learning models for robot solar panel cleaning. Data augmentation techniques like synthetic data generation, time-series transformation (shifting, interpolation, and resampling), and extreme condition simulation were used to enhance data diversity and model generalization. Machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines, deep learning, and ensemble learning, were compared to identify their sensitivity to these techniques. Our experimental findings show that ensemble models (stacking and boosting) show the maximum improvement in predictive accuracy with the added benefit of higher diversity and strength in features. Deep learning models show moderate gains primarily in feature extraction, and simple models such as logistic regression show little impact, indicating the model-dependent effectiveness of data augmentation. Despite better generalization, ensemble methods are at the expense of increased computational cost, indicating a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The study employs widely used machine learning frameworks and libraries for data preprocessing, augmentation, model training, and evaluation, ensuring robust and scalable implementation.},

ABSTRACT = {Optimizing wind turbine control is a major challenge due to wind variability and nonlinearity. This research seeks to improve the performance of wind turbines by designing and developing hybrid intelligent controllers that combine advanced artificial intelligence techniques. A control system combining deep neural networks and fuzzy logic was implemented to optimize the efficiency and operational stability of a 3.5 MW wind turbine. This study analyzed several deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, CNN, ANN, and transformers) to predict the generated power, using data from the SCADA system. The structure of the hybrid controller includes a fuzzy inference system with 28 rules based on linguistic variables that consider power, wind speed, and wind direction. Experiments showed that the hybrid-GRU controller achieved the best balance between predictive performance and computational efficiency, with an R2 of 0.96 and 12,119.54 predictions per second. The GRU excels in overall optimization. This study confirms intelligent hybrid controllers’ effectiveness in improving wind turbines’ performance under various operating conditions, contributing significantly to the field of wind energy.},

ABSTRACT = {Countries aim to reduce fossil fuel usage and related environmental issues through various demand- and supply-side policies. Numerous studies have assessed the policies’ overview. However, analysis of the impacts and effectiveness of these policies in addressing transport-related CO2 emissions is limited globally and in countries like New Zealand, which have a lower CO2 emissions energy intensity compared to Europe, Asia, and Oceania averages. Therefore, this study first analyses the trends in energy consumption and CO2 emissions within the transport sector across the ten largest total CO2-emitting countries, as well as the ten largest transport CO2-emitting OECD countries. It then provides a systematic review of the relevant policies and, finally, estimates two econometric models to explore the effects of these policies on the energy market, aimed at reducing GHG emissions globally from the transport sector, with New Zealand as a case study. The study findings indicate that the transport sector remains a significant contributor to global fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, accounting for 40.4% and 23.3%, respectively, in 2024. The ten largest CO2-emitting countries—China, the United States, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, Iran, Canada, and Saudi Arabia—are responsible for 68% of global emissions. Additionally, the ten OECD countries, except the US, with the highest transport CO2 emissions—Japan, Germany, South Korea, Canada, Mexico, the UK, Italy, France, Spain, and Australia—accounted for 15.7% of the world’s total transport CO2 emissions. Although the share of renewable energy and electricity consumption in the transport sector has steadily risen to 3.54% and 1.4%, respectively, in 2022, further adoption of these sources can considerably lower greenhouse gas emissions in this sector. Results also indicate that both demand- and supply-side policies effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with their impact amplified when implemented together. In New Zealand, demand-side policies have proven to be more effective in reducing emissions than supply-side strategies alone, though combining them is the most efficient approach. This study emphasizes the importance of strategic policy implementation to guide the world toward sustainable development.},

ABSTRACT = {To ensure the reliability and security of Colombia’s national power system, there is an ongoing necessity for upgrades in monitoring and protection mechanisms. Approximately sixteen years ago, the introduction of synchrophasor measurements enabled the swift detection of potentially network-detrimental events. Subsequent advancements have seen the deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), currently tallying 150 across 25 substations, facilitating real-time monitoring and analysis. The growth of the PMU network is pivotal for the modernization of the National Control Center, particularly in the face of complexities introduced by renewable energy sources. There is an increasing demand for data analytics platforms to support operators in responding to threats. This paper explores the development of the Colombian Wide-Area Measurement System (WAMS) network, highlighting its milestones and advancements. Significant contributions include the technological evolution of the WAMS for real-time monitoring, an innovative high-speed data analytics strategy, and tools for the monitoring of frequency, rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), angular differences, oscillations, and voltage recovery, alongside industry-specific criteria for real-time assessment. Implemented within an operational WAMS, these tools enhance situational awareness, thereby assisting operators in decision-making and augmenting the power system’s reliability, security, and efficiency, underscoring their significance in modernization and sustainability initiatives.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydropower, a proven renewable electricity generation technology, has satisfied approximately 16% of the global annual electricity consumption up to the present day. In Greece, hydropower applications throughout the last thirty years have covered almost 6–10% of the mainland’s annual electricity demand. The present work examines the long-term performance and the current status of hydropower applications in Greece as well as their potential contribution to accomplishing the national energy targets set in compliance with the European Directives. A dedicated visualization of large hydropower (LHP) plants’ main characteristics is also performed. Moreover, a critical evaluation of the existing LHP plants’ energy yield-based time evolution is carried out, attempting to provide insights into any fundamental trends and similarities. The analysis reveals that the majority of Greek LHP plants are primarily used to meet the corresponding mainland’s peak load demand. To this end, acknowledging the power balancing service capacity of pumped hydro storage stations, the prospects and the challenges for the specific energy storage technology’s deployment are also emphasized.},

ABSTRACT = {Renewable energy systems (RES) are strongly affected by many sources of uncertainty and variability. Nevertheless, traditional technical and economic evaluation methods often neglect uncertainty by deterministically assuming average nominal values, using simple sensitivity analysis to explore effects of changing conditions, or limiting to a few sources of uncertainty. Furthermore, long-term variability and changing scenarios during the life of the system are not considered. This leads to inaccurate estimation of inherent investment risk. To address this gap, this work proposes a framework for the economic evaluation of offshore wind farms, considering the effects of both epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. Uncertainty of correlations used to model the system, the variability of resources and energy prices, as well as the use of a financial hedging tool to cope with market risk, the impact of failures and disruptive events, the changing of long-term scenarios during the system’s life, and the wake effect due to wind direction variability are all considered. As demonstrated through an example of an application, this methodology will be useful to practitioners and academics to achieve a more realistic assessment of the profitability of the investment based on a more comprehensive propagation of uncertainty.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban trees reduce particulate matter (PM) concentrations through dry deposition, interception, and modifying wind patterns, improving air quality and saving public health expenses in urban planning. The main objective of this article is to present an analysis of the influence of urban trees on PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in a high-altitude Latin American megacity (Bogotá, Colombia) using UFORE-D modeling. Six PM monitoring stations distributed throughout the megacity were used. Hourly climatic and PM data were collected for seven years, along with dendrometric and cartographic analyses within 200 m of the monitoring stations. Land cover was quantified using satellite imagery (Landsat 8) in order to perform a spatial analysis. The results showed that the UFORE-D model effectively quantified urban forest canopy area (CA) impact on PM10 and PM2.5 removal, showing strong correlations (R2 = 0.987 and 0.918). PM removal increased with both CA and ambient pollutant concentrations, with CA exhibiting greater influence. Sensitivity analysis highlighted enhanced air quality with increased leaf area index (LAI: 2–4 m2/m2), particularly at higher wind speeds. PM10 removal (1.05 ± 0.01%) per unit CA exceeded PM2.5 (0.71 ± 0.09%), potentially due to resuspension modeling. Model validation confirmed reliability across urban settings, emphasizing its utility in urban planning. Scenario analysis (E1–E4, CA: 8.30–95.4%) demonstrated a consistent positive correlation between CA and PM removal, with diminishing returns at extreme CA levels. Urban spatial constraints suggested integrated green infrastructure solutions. Although increased CA improved PM removal rates, the absolute reduction of pollutants remained limited, suggesting comprehensive emission monitoring.},

ABSTRACT = {The Okavango River is a transboundary waterway that flows through Angola, Namibia, and Botswana, forming a significant alluvial fan in northwestern Botswana. This fan creates a Delta that plays a vital role in the country’s GDP through tourism. While research has primarily focused on the Delta, the river’s catchment area in the Angolan highlands—its main water source and critical for downstream flow—has been largely overlooked. The basin is under pressure from development, water abstraction, and population growth in the surrounding areas, which negatively affect the environment. These challenges are intensified by climate change, leading to increased water scarcity that necessitates improved management strategies. Currently, there is a lack of published research on the basin’s hydrology, leaving many hydrological parameters related to streamflow in the catchments inadequately understood. Most existing studies have employed single-site calibration methods, which fail to capture the diverse characteristics of the basin’s catchments. To address this, a SWAT model has been developed to simulate the hydrologic behaviour of the basin using sequential multisite calibration with data from five gauging stations, including the main river systems: Cubango and Cuito. The SUFI2 program was used for sensitivity analysis, calibration, and validation. The initial sensitivity analysis identified several key parameters: the Soil Evaporation Compensation Factor (ESCO), the SCS curve number under moisture condition II (CN2), Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity (SOL_K), and Moist Bulk Density (SOL_BD) as the most influential. The calibration and validation results were generally satisfactory, with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.47 to 0.72. Analysis of the water balance and parameter sensitivities revealed the varied hydrologic responses of different sub-watersheds with distinct soil profiles. Average annual precipitation varies from 1116 mm upstream to 369 mm downstream, with an evapotranspiration-to-precipitation ratio ranging from 0.47 to 0.95 and a water yield ratio between 0.51 and 0.03, thereby revealing their spatial gradients, notably increasing evapotranspiration and decreasing water yield downstream. The SWAT model’s water balance components provided promising results, with soil moisture data aligned with the TerraClimate dataset, achieving a coefficient of determination of 0.63. Additionally, the model captured the influence of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on local hydrology. However, limitations were noted in simulating peak and low flows due to sparse gauge coverage, data gaps (e.g., groundwater abstraction, point sources), and the use of coarse-resolution climate inputs.},
