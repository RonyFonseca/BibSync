ABSTRACT = {In order to assist in high-yield agricultural management in multiple cropping systems, it is essential to understand the link between the rainy season onset and crops sowing dates, since it considerably affects the management, yield and output. We built crop calendars derived from remote sensing products and investigated the link between sowing dates and the onset of the rainy season in irrigated and rainfed agriculture in Western Bahia, a new and important agricultural frontier in Brazilian Cerrado. Crop sowing dates were obtained from green-up dates from 2001 to 2019. Rainy season onset dates were determined using CHIRPS daily precipitation data. Results indicate that sowing occurs from 26 October to 15 November and the rainy season starts from 17 to 27 October. Rainfed sowing dates are strongly correlated to rainy season onset and are particularly affected in years where rains are delayed. Sowing dates in irrigated pixels occur up to 25 days earlier than rainfed and are not correlated to rainy season onset. Irrigated farms are sowing earlier and in a shorter window than rainfed, with a stronger resilience in years where rains are delayed, and have adapted their sowing operation towards a more intensive agriculture and efficient water use during the rainy season.},

ABSTRACT = {Almost fifty years have passed since the idea to retrieve a value for Evapotranspiration (ET) using remote sensing techniques was first considered. Numerous ET models have been proposed, validated and improved along these five decades, as the satellites and sensors onboard were enhanced. This study reviews most of the efforts in the progress towards providing a trustworthy value of ET by means of thermal remote sensing data. It starts with an in-depth reflection of the surface energy balance concept and of each of its terms, followed by the description of the approaches taken by remote sensing models to estimate ET from it in the last thirty years. This work also includes a chronological review of the modifications suggested by several researchers, as well as representative validations studies of such ET models. Present limitations of ET estimated with remote sensors onboard orbiting satellites, as well as at surface level, are raised. Current trends to face such limitations and a future perspective of the discipline are also exposed, for the reader’s inspiration.},

ABSTRACT = {Predicting soil chemical properties such as soil organic carbon (SOC) and available phosphorus (Ava-P) content is critical in areas where different land uses exist. The distribution of SOC and Ava-P is influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors. This study aimed at (1) predicting SOC and Ava-P in a piedmont plain of Northeast Iran using the Random Forests (RF) and Cubist mathematical models and hybrid models (Regression Kriging), (2) comparing the models’ results, and (3) identifying the key variables that influence the spatial dynamics of soil SOC and Ava-P under different agricultural practices. The machine learning models were trained with 201 composite surface soil samples and 24 ancillary data, including climate (C), organism (O), topography- relief (R), parent material (P) and key soil features (S) according to the SCORPAN digital soil mapping framework, which can predictively represent soil formation factors spatially. Clay, one of the most critical soil properties with a well-known relationship to SOC, was the most important predictor of SOC, followed by open-access multispectral satellite images-based vegetation and soil indices. Ava-P had a similar set of effective variables. Hybrid approaches did not improve model accuracy significantly, but they did reduce map uncertainty. In the validation set, Ava-P was calculated using the RF algorithm with a normalized root mean square (NRMSE) of 96.8, while SOC was calculated using the Cubist algorithm with an NRMSE of 94.2. These values did not change when using the hybrid technique for Ava-P; however, they changed just by 1% for SOC. The management of SOC content and the supply of Ava-P in agricultural activities can be guided by SOC and Ava-P digital distribution maps. Produced digital maps in which the soil scientist plays an active role can be used to identify areas where concentrations are high and need to be protected, where uncertainty is high and sampling is required for further monitoring.},

ABSTRACT = {Mangroves, which are vulnerable to natural threats and human activities on small islands in the tropics, play an essential role as carbon sinks, helping to mitigate climate change. In this study, we discussed the effect of natural factors on mangrove sustainability by analyzing the impact of rainfall, land surface temperature (LST), and tidal inundation on the greenness of mangroves in Karimunjawa National Park (KNP), Indonesia. We used Sentinel-2 image data to obtain the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) during the dry season to determine the effect of inundation on mangrove greenness and soil moisture. The tidal inundation area was calculated using topographic data from the KNP and tidal observations from the area adjacent to it. Unmanned autonomous vehicles and topographic data were used to estimate mangrove canopy height. We also calculated mangrove greenness phenology and compared it to rainfall from satellite data from 2019–2021. Results show that the intertidal area is dominated by taller mangroves and has higher NDVI and NDMI values than non-intertidal areas. We also observed that mangroves in intertidal areas are mostly evergreen, and optimum greenness in KNP occurs from February to October, with maximum greenness in July. Cross-correlation analysis suggests that high rainfall affects NDVI, with peak greenness occurring three months after high rainfall. The LST and NDVI cross-correlation showed no time lag. This suggests that LST was not the main factor controlling mangrove greenness, suggesting tides and rainfall influence mangrove greenness. The mangroves are also vulnerable to climate variability and change, which limits rainfall. However, sea-level rise due to climate change might positively impact mangrove greenness.},

ABSTRACT = {Rice is one of the most important food crops around the world. Remote sensing technology, as an effective and rapidly developing method, has been widely applied to precise rice management. To observe the current research status in the field of rice remote sensing (RRS), a bibliometric analysis was carried out based on 2680 papers of RRS published during 1980–2021, which were collected from the core collection of the Web of Science database. Quantitative analysis of the number of publications, top countries and institutions, popular keywords, etc. was conducted through the knowledge mapping software CiteSpace, and comprehensive discussions were carried out from the aspects of specific research objects, methods, spectral variables, and sensor platforms. The results revealed that an increasing number of countries and institutions have conducted research on RRS and a great number of articles have been published annually, among which, China, the United States of America, and Japan were the top three and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhejiang University, and Nanjing Agricultural University were the first three research institutions with the largest publications. Abundant interest was paid to “reflectance”, followed by “vegetation index” and “yield” and the specific objects mainly focused on growth, yield, area, stress, and quality. From the perspective of spectral variables, reflectance, vegetation index, and back-scattering coefficient appeared the most frequently in the frontiers. In addition to satellite remote sensing data and empirical models, unmanned air vehicle (UAV) platforms and artificial intelligence models have gradually become hot topics. This study enriches the readers’ understanding and highlights the potential future research directions in RRS.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, with its fine spatial and temporal resolution, is used to study the wind speed and direction characteristics in the Mediterranean basin from 1979 to 2020. Their variability, trend and mean values, as well as their association, are examined in the monthly, annual and interannual/decadal time scales. The long-term variability of the wind direction is assessed using the angular variance, while the mean annual and interannual variability are used for the wind speed. The most characteristic and constant flow systems appear in the Gulf of Lion (Mistral) and the Aegean Sea during the summer (Etesian winds). The mean annual variability maximizes in the northern part of the basin, while the western part appears to have the most variable wind directions, while the fastest increasing wind speeds appear in the southwestern Levantine sub-basin. The long-term linear trend for the mean, the 95th and 99th quantiles of annual wind speed and the number of occurrences of extreme wind events have been also assessed. For particular areas, there is an increasing tendency in both intensity and frequency of occurrence of extreme wind events. Τhe linear-circular correlation coefficient has been implemented in order to quantify the linear association between the wind direction and the wind speed. This parameter demonstrates higher annual values for the Mistral wind in the Gulf of Lion and the Etesian winds in the Aegean Sea during the summer. Finally, the comparison of the results of ERA5 with the results of ERA-Interim highlighted significant differences in the Mediterranean wind speed and direction characteristics.},

ABSTRACT = {Certain weather conditions are inadvertently related to increased population of various mosquitoes. In order to predict the burden of mosquito populations in the Global South, it is imperative to integrate weather-related risk factors into such predictive models. There are a lot of online open-source weather platforms that provide historical, current and future weather forecasts which can be utilised for general predictions, and these electronic sources serve as an alternate option for weather data when physical weather stations are inaccessible (or inactive). Before using data from such online source, it is important to assess the accuracy against some baseline measure. In this paper, we therefore evaluated the accuracy and suitability of weather forecasts of two parameters namely temperature and humidity from the OpenWeatherMap API (an online weather platform) and compared them with actual measurements collected from the Brazilian weather stations (INMET). The evaluation was focused on two Brazilian cites, namely, Recife and Campina Grande. The intention is to prepare an early warning model which will harness data from OpenWeatherMap API for mosquito prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {Diffuse solar radiation is an essential component of surface solar radiation that contributes to carbon sequestration, photovoltaic power generation, and renewable energy production in terrestrial ecosystems. We constructed a 39-year (1982–2020) daily diffuse solar radiation dataset (CHSSDR), using ERA5 and MERRA_2 reanalysis data, with a spatial resolution of 10 km through a developed ensemble model (generalized additive models, GAM). The validation results, with ground-based measurements, showed that GAM had a high and stable performance with the correlation coefficient (R), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) for the sample-based cross-validations of 0.88, 19.54 Wm−2, and 14.87 Wm−2, respectively. CHSSDR had the highest consistency with ground-based measurements among the four diffuse solar radiation products (CERES, ERA5, JiEA, and CHSSDR), with the least deviation (MAE = 15.06 Wm−2 and RMSE = 20.22 Wm−2) and highest R value (0.87). The diffuse solar radiation values in China range from 59.13 to 104.65 Wm−2, with a multi-year average value of 79.39 Wm−2 from 1982 to 2020. Generally, low latitude and low altitude regions have larger diffuse solar radiation than high latitude and high altitude regions, and eastern China has less diffuse solar radiation than western China. This dataset would be valuable for analyzing regional climate change, photovoltaic applications, and solar energy resources. The dataset is freely available from figshare.},

ABSTRACT = {Biological invasion has been one of the reasons that coastal wetlands gradually lose their ecological services. The current study investigates the spread of a commonly found invasive species in coastal wetlands in Northeastern US, the Phragmites australis. Within a relatively pristine wetland complex in coastal New Jersey, we collected high-resolution multispectral remote sensing images for eight years (2011–2018), in both winter and summer seasons. The land cover/land use status in this wetland complex is relatively simple, contains only five identifiable vegetation covers and water. Applying high accuracy machine learning algorithms, we are able to classify the land use/land cover in the complex and use the classified images as the basis for the grey system coupled system dynamics simulative model. The simulative model produces land use land cover change in the wetland complex for the next 25 years. Results suggest that Phragmites australis will increase in coverage in the future, despite the stable intensity of anthropogenic activities. The wetland complex could lose its essential ecological services to serve as an exchange spot for nekton species from the sea.},

ABSTRACT = {In general, studies on short-term hourly electricity load modeling and forecasting do not investigate in detail the sources of uncertainty in forecasting. This study aims to evaluate the impact and benefits of applying bootstrap aggregation in overcoming the uncertainty in time series forecasting, thereby increasing the accuracy of multistep ahead point forecasts. We implemented the existing and proposed clustering-based bootstrapping methods to generate new electricity load time series. In the proposed method, we use singular spectrum analysis to decompose the series between signal and noise to reduce the variance of the bootstrapped series. The noise is then bootstrapped by K-means clustering-based generation of Gaussian normal distribution (KM.N) before adding it back to the signal, resulting in the bootstrapped series. We apply the benchmark models for electricity load forecasting, SARIMA, NNAR, TBATS, and DSHW, to model all new bootstrapped series and determine the multistep ahead point forecasts. The forecast values obtained from the original series are compared with the mean and median across all forecasts calculated from the bootstrapped series using the Malaysian, Polish, and Indonesian hourly load series for 12, 24, and 36 steps ahead. We conclude that, in this case, the proposed bootstrapping method improves the accuracy of multistep-ahead forecast values, especially when considering the SARIMA and NNAR models.},

ABSTRACT = {With the recent increase in the occurrence of severe weather phenomena, the development of accurate weather nowcasting is of paramount importance. Among the computational methods that are used to predict the evolution of weather, deep learning techniques offer a particularly appealing solution due to their capability for learning patterns from large amounts of data and their fast inference times. In this paper, we propose a convolutional network for weather forecasting that is based on radar product prediction. Our model (NeXtNow) adapts the ResNeXt architecture that has been proposed in the computer vision literature to solve the spatiotemporal prediction problem. NeXtNow consists of an encoder–decoder convolutional architecture, which maps radar measurements from the past onto radar measurements that are recorded in the future. The ResNeXt architecture was chosen as the basis for our network due to its flexibility, which allows for the design of models that can be customized for specific tasks by stacking multiple blocks of the same type. We validated our approach using radar data that were collected from the Romanian National Meteorological Administration (NMA) and the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET) and we empirically showed that the inclusion of multiple past radar measurements led to more accurate predictions further in the future. We also showed that NeXtNow could outperform XNow, which is a convolutional architecture that has previously been proposed for short-term radar data prediction and has a performance that is comparable to those of other similar approaches in the nowcasting literature. Compared to XNow, NeXtNow provided improvements to the critical success index that ranged from 1% to 17% and improvements to the root mean square error that ranged from 5% to 6%.},

This paper aims to give a general overview of the concept of ramp rate limitation and its principal applications in the literature regarding the field of control strategies, which deal with smoothing the wind power output. Wind power is one of the most-used renewable energy sources, and the objective of limiting the ramp rate of the power output is to produce more stable power. The studies of ramp rate limitation applied in wind power production deal with the definition and detection of this phenomenon in the real data, the methodologies used to forecast it, its application for managing grids and microgrids, the different actions aimed at physically implementing the restriction, and some of the grid code requirements used in different nations.},

ABSTRACT = {Sustainable forest management requires accurate biometric tools to estimate forest site quality. This is particularly relevant for prescribing adequate silvicultural treatments of forest management planning. The aim of this research was to incorporate topographic and climatic variables into dominant height growth models of patula pine stands to improve the estimation of forest stand productivity. Three generalized algebraic difference approach (GADA) models were fit to a dataset from 66 permanent sampling plots, with six re-measurements and 77 temporary inventory sampling plots established on forest stands of patula pine. The nested iterative approach was used to fit the GADA models, and goodness-of-fit statistics such as the root mean square error, Akaike’s Information Criterion, and Bias were used to assess their performance. A Hossfeld IV GADA equation type that includes altitude, slope percentage, mean annual precipitation, and mean annual minimum temperature produced the best fit and estimation. Forest site productivity was negatively affected by altitude, while increasing the mean annual minimum temperature suggested the fastest-growing rates for dominant tree height.},

ABSTRACT = {Maintaining stability and control over the electric system requires increasing information about the consumers’ profiling due to changes in the form of electricity generation and consumption. To overcome this trouble, short-term load forecasting (STLF) on individual consumers gained importance in the last years. Nonetheless, predicting the profile of an individual consumer is a difficult task. The main challenge lies in the uncertainty related to the individual consumption profile, which increases forecasting errors. Thus, this paper aims to implement a load predictive model focused on individual consumers taking into account its randomness. For this purpose, a methodology is proposed to determine and select predictive features for individual STLF. The load forecasting of an individual consumer is simulated based on the four main machine learning techniques used in the literature. A 2.73% reduction in the forecast error is obtained after the correct selection of the predictive features. Compared to the baseline model (persistent forecasting method), the error is reduced by up to 19.8%. Among the techniques analyzed, support vector regression (SVR) showed the smallest errors (8.88% and 9.31%).},

ABSTRACT = {Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is of great significance in studies of hydrological cycle, agricultural water resources, and hydrometeorology. The present study collected daily meteorological data at 536 meteorological stations in China from 1984 to 2019, calculated daily ET0 using the FAO Penman–Monteith equation, analyzed the spatial distribution and temporal variation characteristics of ET0 and meteorological variables at four different spatial scales (continental, regional, provincial, and local), and discussed the sensitivity of ET0 to the meteorological variables and the contribution rates of the meteorological variables to the ET0 variations. The results showed that ET0 increased at 406 out of the 536 stations (75.7%), with the trends being significant at 65 stations at the 5% significance level, and 147 at the 1% significance level. The slope calculated using Sen’s method and linear trend method showed that the annual ET0 at the continental scale increased by approximately 12 mm/decade. Most of the stations showed decreasing trends in relative humidity (Hm), sunshine duration (SD), and wind speed at 2 m height (U2) while increasing trends in the maximum air temperature (Tmax) and minimum air temperature (Tmin). ET0 was most sensitive to Hm (sensitivity coefficient, St = −0.66), followed by Tmax (St = 0.29), SD (St = 0.18), U2 (St = 0.16), and Tmin (St = 0.07). Most of the stations showed increasing trends in St for Hm (56.16%), Tmax (72.95%), Tmin (87.31%), and U2 (90.49%), and decreasing trends for SD (69.78%). The variations in Hm, Tmax, and Tmin increased the ET0 at most of the stations (82.28%, 98.13%, and 69.03%, respectively). The variations in SD and U2 decreased ET0 at most of the stations (66.04% and 56.34%, respectively). Some ET0 characteristics in a few regions can be well described using a single spatial scale. However, most regions exhibited significantly different ET0 characteristics across spatial scales. The results of this project can provide reference for hydrological analysis and agricultural water management under climate change conditions and provide data and information for other hydrology-related applications.},

ABSTRACT = {To improve the monitoring of the electrical power grid, it is necessary to evaluate the influence of contamination in relation to leakage current and its progression to a disruptive discharge. In this paper, insulators were tested in a saline chamber to simulate the increase of salt contamination on their surface. From the time series forecasting of the leakage current, it is possible to evaluate the development of the fault before a flashover occurs. In this paper, for a complete evaluation, the long short-term memory (LSTM), group method of data handling (GMDH), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), bootstrap aggregation (bagging), sequential learning (boosting), random subspace, and stacked generalization (stacking) ensemble learning models are analyzed. From the results of the best structure of the models, the hyperparameters are evaluated and the wavelet transform is used to obtain an enhanced model. The contribution of this paper is related to the improvement of well-established models using the wavelet transform, thus obtaining hybrid models that can be used for several applications. The results showed that using the wavelet transform leads to an improvement in all the used models, especially the wavelet ANFIS model, which had a mean RMSE of 1.58 ×10−3, being the model that had the best result. Furthermore, the results for the standard deviation were 2.18 ×10−19, showing that the model is stable and robust for the application under study. Future work can be performed using other components of the distribution power grid susceptible to contamination because they are installed outdoors.},

ABSTRACT = {The Pantanal is the world’s largest and most biodiverse continental sheet-flow wetland. Recently, vast tracts of the Pantanal have succumbed to the occurrence of fires, raising serious concerns over the future integrity of the biodiversity and ecosystem services of this biome, including revenues from ecotourism. These wildfires degrade the baseline of natural ecosystems and the ecotourism economy across the region. Local residents (“Pantaneiros”) anecdotally state that extensive cattle herbivory can solve the contemporary flammability problem of the Pantanal by controlling vegetation biomass, thereby preventing or reducing both fuel loads and fires across the region. Here, we examine the covariation between the presence and density of cattle and the incidence of fires across the Brazilian Pantanal. Variables assessed included bovine cattle density, SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index), GPP (Gross Primary Productivity)/biomass estimate, and fire foci along a 19-year time series (2001 to 2019). Our findings show that fire foci across the Pantanal biome are related to climatic variables, such as lower annual precipitation and higher annual drought indices (SPI) rather than to cattle stocking rates. Therefore, the notion of “cattle firefighting”, a popular concept often discussed in some academic circles, cannot be validated because cattle numbers are unrelated to aboveground phytomass. Gross primary productivity further invalidated the “cattle herbivory” hypothesis because GPP was found to be strongly correlated with cattle density but not with the spatial distribution of fires. Fires throughout the Pantanal are currently aggravated by the presence of livestock and result from a combination of extreme weather events and outdated agricultural practices.},

ABSTRACT = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems are dependent on solar irradiation and environmental temperature to achieve their best performance. One of the challenges in the photovoltaic industry is performing maintenance as soon as a system is not working at its full generation capacity. The lack of a proper maintenance schedule affects power generation performance and can also decrease the lifetime of photovoltaic modules. Regarding the impact of environmental variables on the performance of PV systems, research has shown that soiling is the third most common reason for power loss in photovoltaic power plants, after solar irradiance and environmental temperature. This paper proposes a new statistical predictor for forecasting PV power generation by measuring environmental variables and the estimated mass particles (soiling) on the PV system. Our proposal was based on the fit of a nonlinear mixed-effects model, according to a log-logistic function. Two advantages of this approach are that it assumes a nonlinear relationship between the generated power and the environmental conditions (solar irradiance and the presence of suspended particulates) and that random errors may be correlated since the power generation measurements are recorded longitudinally. We evaluated the model using a dataset comprising environmental variables and power samples that were collected from October 2019 to April 2020 in a PV power plant in mid-west Brazil. The fitted model presented a maximum mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0032 and a linear coefficient correlation between the predicted and observed values of 0.9997. The estimated average daily loss due to soiling was 1.4%.},

ABSTRACT = {The study evaluated the ability of 11 global climate models of the latest two versions of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6) to simulate observed (1965–2005) rainfall, maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures, mean eastward (uas) and northward (vas) wind speed, and mean surface pressure. It also evaluated relative uncertainty in projections of climate variables using those two CMIPs. The European reanalysis (ERA5) data were used as the reference to evaluate the performance of the GCMs and their mean and median multimodel ensembles (MME). The study revealed less bias in CMIP6 GCMs than CMIP5 GCMs in simulating most climate variables. The biases in rainfall, Tmax, Tmin, uas, vas, and surface pressure were −55 mm, 0.28 °C, −0.11 °C, −0.25 m/s, −0.06 m/s, and −0.038 Kpa for CMIP6 compared to −65 mm, 0.07 °C, −0.87 °C, −0.41 m/s, −0.05 m/s, and 0.063 Kpa for CMIP5. The uncertainty in CMIP6 projections of rainfall, Tmax, Tmin, uas, vas, and wind speed was relative more narrow than those for CMIP5. The projections showed a higher increase in Tmin than Tmax by 0.64 °C, especially in the central region. Besides, rainfall in most parts of MENA would increase; however, it might decrease by 50 mm in the coastal regions. The study revealed the better ability of CMIP6 GCMs for a wide range of climatic studies.},

ABSTRACT = {As one of two most important cereals in the world, and with the continuous increase in population and demand for food consumption worldwide, rice has been attracting researchers’ attention for improving its potential yield in the future, particularly as it relates to climate change. However, what will be the potential limit of world rice yield in the future, and how does global warming affect the yield of world rice? Therefore, analyzing the potential yield of world rice affected by global warming is of great significance to direct crop production worldwide in the future. However, by far, most modeled estimations of rice yield are based on the principle of production function from static biological dimension and at local or regional levels, whereas few are based on a time series model from a dynamic evolutionary angle and on global scale. Thus, in this paper, both average and top (national) yields of world rice by 2030 are projected creatively using the Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average and Trend Regression (ARIMA-TR) model and based on historic yields since 1961; in addition, the impact of global warming on the yields of world rice is analyzed using a binary regression model in which global mean temperature is treated as the independent variable whereas the yield is expressed as the dependent variable. Our study concludes that between 2021 and 2030, the average yield of world rice is projected to be from 4835 kg/ha to 5195 kg/ha, the top yield from 10,127 kg/ha to 10,269 kg/ha, or the average yield ranging from 47.74% to 50.59% of the top yield. From 1961 to 2020, through to2030, global warming will exert a negative impact on the average yield of world rice less than that of the top yield, which partly drives the gap between these two yields and gradually narrowed; for world rice by 2030, the opportunities for improving global production should be dependent on both high and low yield countries as the average yield is approaching the turning point of an S-shaped curve in the long-term trend. These insights provide the academic circle with innovative comprehension of world rice yield and its biological evolution for global food security relating to global warming in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid increase in solar photovoltaic (PV) integration into electricity networks introduces technical challenges due to varying PV outputs. Rapid ramp events due to cloud movements are of particular concern for the operation of remote islanded microgrids (IMGs) with high solar PV penetration. PV systems and optionally controllable distributed energy resources (DERs) in IMGs can be operated in an optimised way based on nowcasting (forecasting up to 60 min ahead). This study aims to evaluate the performance under Perth, Western Australian conditions, of an all-sky imager (ASI)-based nowcasting system, installed at Murdoch University in Perth, Western Australia (WA). Nowcast direct normal irradiance (DNI) and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) are inputted into a 5 kWp solar PV system with a direct current (DC) power rating/alternating current (AC) power rating ratio of 1.0. A newly developed classification method provided a simplified irradiance variability classification. The obtained nowcasting system evaluation results show that the nowcasting system’s accuracy decreases with an increase in lead time (LT). Additionally, the nowcasting system’s accuracy is higher when the weather is either mostly clear (with a recorded LT15 mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.38 kW) or overcast (with a recorded LT15 MAD of 0.19 kW) than when the weather is intermittently cloudy with varying cloud conditions (with a recorded LT15 MAD of 0.44 kW). With lower errors observed in lower LTs, overall, it might be possible to integrate the nowcasting system into the design of IMG controllers. The overall performance of the nowcasting system at Murdoch University was as expected as it is comparable to the previous evaluations in five other different sites, namely, PSA, La Africana, Evora, Oldenburg, and Julich.},

ABSTRACT = {Electric vehicle (EV) charging may impose a substantial power demand on existing low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) networks, which are usually not prepared for high power demands in short time intervals. The influx of E-mobility may require an increase in grid reinforcements, but these can be reduced and optimized by a combination of new technologies, tools, and strategies, such as the deployment of solar PV generation integrated with aggregated energy storage systems. One of the challenges in the implementation of charging infrastructures in public stations is coupling the projected sizes of energy demand and power requirements in each location for each charger. This paper describes a method to estimate projected values for energy consumption and power demand in EV fast charging stations (CS). The proposed ideas were applied in a concept facility located in Campinas, Brazil, in a structure equipped with two 50 kW DC Fast Chargers, local 12.5 kW/13.2 kWp PV generation (to reduce energy impacts to the grid), and a 100 kW/200 kWh storage system, using electrochemical batteries (to minimize peak power requirements).},

ABSTRACT = {Conventional drought indices based on stationary assumptions are no longer appropriate for drought assessments conducted under conditions with climate change or anthropogenic influences. In this study, a time-varying Nonstationary Standardized Precipitation Index (NSPEI) was developed by fitting a time covariate with the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS), with a time-scale of six months. Daily precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature datasets from 1979–2020 that were based on the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) global unified gauge-based analysis with a resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° were used. The results of the study indicated that both precipitation and evapotranspiration in China had increased significantly over the past 42 years in China and that Northwest China would become drier. By extracting the return objects of the GAMLSS, this study identified Northwest China (Continental River Basin) as the main region wherein the distribution parameters of the non-stationary models changed; this region was identified as the one concentrated with nonstationary hotspot response areas. A comparison of drought duration and severity showed that the stationary SPEI under-estimated the severity of the drought. The severity was under-estimated in the spring–summer and fall–winter seasons for Northwest and Southwest of China, respectively; more attention should be paid to these regions. This study provides results that can support nonstationary drought research; droughts can be identified more precisely, and early warnings can be provided for them.},

ABSTRACT = {With the objective of establishing methods for high-quality marine development and effective marine management, this review focuses on four dimensions of marine development: marine economy, marine resources, marine ecology, and marine accounting. The focus of marine economy research is the marine industry, with the marine circular economy being the latest research frontier. Marine resources are the foundation of the marine economy. To use different types of marine resources more efficiently, it is necessary to apply the property right system of natural resources to marine fields. The healthy development of the marine economy is guaranteed by marine ecology. How to scientifically measure marine ecological loss and evaluate the marine ecological environment carrying capacity and marine ecological security is key to the sustainable development of the marine economy. The development of the marine economy is based on successful marine accounting. The lack of marine data globally has made marine accounting controversial. The study aims to review the development history and latest research frontiers for various marine-related fields and identify existing problems in the processes of marine economic development and marine management, with a view to finding a breakthrough for transforming and upgrading marine development, improving the marine economic governance system, and strengthening the modernization of marine governance capacity, so as to better develop and utilize the oceans.},

ABSTRACT = {As non-renewable energy sources are in the verge of exhaustion, the entire world turns towards renewable sources to fill its energy demand. In the near future, solar energy will be a major contributor of renewable energy, but the integration of unreliable solar energy sources directly into the grid makes the existing system complex. To reduce the complexity, a microgrid system is a better solution. Solar energy forecasting models improve the reliability of the solar plant in microgrid operations. Uncertainty in solar energy prediction is the challenge in generating reliable energy. Employing, understanding, training, and evaluating several forecasting models with available meteorological data will ensure the selection of an appropriate forecast model for any particular location. New strategies and approaches emerge day by day to increase the model accuracy, with an ultimate objective of minimizing uncertainty in forecasting. Conventional methods include a lot of differential mathematical calculations. Large data availability at solar stations make use of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for computing, forecasting, and predicting solar radiation energy. The recent evolution of ensemble and hybrid models predicts solar radiation accurately compared to all the models. This paper reviews various models in solar irradiance and power estimation which are tabulated by classification types mentioned.},

ABSTRACT = {This study identifies the spatial and temporal trends, as well as the drivers, of fire dynamics in the Bolivian Amazon basin. Bolivia ranks in the top ten countries in terms of total annual burnt, with fires affecting an estimated 2.3 million hectares of forest in 2020. However, in comparison to the Brazilian Amazon, there has been little research into the fire regime in Bolivia. The sparse research and the limited literature on the subject indicate that fire activity is higher in the Bolivian Amazon basin’s dry forests and flooded savanna zones, and that agriculture and drought are the primary causes of fire activity. In this study, trend analysis and emerging hotspot analysis are deployed to identify the spatial and temporal patterns of fire activity and boosted regression tree models to identify the drivers of forest fire within each ecoregion of the Bolivian Amazon basin. Comparable to most of the Brazilian literature, this study finds that fire activity and fire season length is higher in the flooded Beni Savanna, and Chiquitano seasonally dry tropical forests than in the Bolivian Amazon ecoregion. This study also identifies moisture stress and human activity as the main drivers of fire dynamics within the region. It is intended that this research will offer a foundation for future research and conservation activities aimed at better understanding the fire regime of the Bolivian Amazon basin.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning (ML) has been widely used worldwide to develop crop yield forecasting models. However, it is still challenging to identify the most critical features from a dataset. Although either feature selection (FS) or feature extraction (FX) techniques have been employed, no research compares their performances and, more importantly, the benefits of combining both methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework that uses non-feature reduction (All-F) as a baseline to investigate the performance of FS, FX, and a combination of both (FSX). The case study employs the vegetation condition index (VCI)/temperature condition index (TCI) to develop 21 rice yield forecasting models for eight sub-regions in Vietnam based on ML methods, namely linear, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (Tree), artificial neural network (ANN), and Ensemble. The results reveal that FSX takes full advantage of the FS and FX, leading FSX-based models to perform the best in 18 out of 21 models, while 2 (1) for FS-based (FX-based) models. These FXS-, FS-, and FX-based models improve All-F-based models at an average level of 21% and up to 60% in terms of RMSE. Furthermore, 21 of the best models are developed based on Ensemble (13 models), Tree (6 models), linear (1 model), and ANN (1 model). These findings highlight the significant role of FS, FX, and specially FSX coupled with a wide range of ML algorithms (especially Ensemble) for enhancing the accuracy of predicting crop yield.},

ABSTRACT = {Most countries, notably those that signed the Paris Climate Agreement, prioritize achieving the zero carbon or carbon neutrality aim. Unlike earlier studies, this one assesses the contribution of environmental policy, clean energy, green innovation, and renewable energy to the E7 economies’ achievement of carbon neutrality goals from 1990 to 2019. Findings emanating from the study show that the EKC hypothesis is valid in E7 countries. Implying that emissions in the E7 countries increased with the kick-off of development but declined later due to possible potent environmental regulatory policies put in place. Similarly, across all models, renewable energy (REN), green innovations (GINNO), environmental tax (ETAX), and technological innovations (TECH) were found to exert a negative and significant impact on carbon emissions in the E7 countries both in the short and long run. On the other hand, economic expansion (GDP) positively impacts environmental deterioration. Furthermore, the country-specific result shows that, on average, Brazil, India, China, Russia, Mexico, and Indonesia have significant environmental policies aiding carbon abatement. Except for Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia, the income growth in the rest of the countries does not follow the EKC proposition. Furthermore, the causality result revealed a unidirectional causal relationship between GDP, REN, and GINNO to CO2 emission. No causality was found between ETAX with CO2, while a bi-directional causality exists between technology and CO2 emissions. Based on the finding, policymakers in the E7 countries should move away from fossil fuels because future electricity output will not be sufficient to reduce emissions considerably. Environmental regulations, encouraging technological innovation, adopting green and sustainable technology, and clean energy sources, among other things, demand radical and broad changes.},

ABSTRACT = {Black carbon (BC) and PM2.5 chemical characterizations are crucial for insight into their impact on the health of the exposed population. PM2.5 sampling was carried out over selected residential sites of Jamshedpur (JSR) and Kharagpur (KGP), east India, during the winter season. Seven selected elements (SO42−, Cl−, Na+, NO3−, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) were analyzed using ion chromatography (IC). Black carbon (BC) sampling was also done at two different sites in JSR and KGP to understand its correlation. The PM2.5 ionic species mass concentration in JSR was in the order of SO42− > Cl− > Na+ > NO3− > K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+, whereas in KGP, it was SO42− > NO3− > Cl− > Na+ > K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+. The back-trajectory analysis showed that most of the air masses during the study period originated from the Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP). The Pearson relations of BC-PM2.5 indicate a better positive correlation (r = 0.66) at KGP compared to JSR (r = 0.42). As shown in the diagnostic ratio analysis, fossil fuel combustion and wood burning account for 51.51% and 36.36% of the total energy consumption in JSR city, respectively. In KGP city, the apportionment of origin sources were fossil fuel and wood burning at 43.75% and 34.37%, respectively. This study provides the first inventory of atmospheric particulate-bound chemical concentrations and BC profiles in middle-east India and informs policymakers and scientists for further studies.},

ABSTRACT = {A better understanding of the relationship between land surface temperature (Ts) and near-surface air temperature (Ta) is crucial for improving the simulation accuracy of climate models, developing retrieval schemes for soil and vegetation moisture, and estimating large-scale Ta from satellite-based Ts observations. In this study, we investigated the relationship between multiple satellite-based Ts products, derived from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua satellite, and Ta from 204 meteorological stations over Brazil during 2003–2016. Monthly satellite-based Ts products used in this study include: (1) AIRS Version 6 with 1° spatial resolution, (2) AIRS Version 7 with 1° spatial resolution, (3) MODIS Collection 6 with 0.05° spatial resolution, and (4) MODIS Collection 6 with 1° spatial resolution re-sampled from (3) for a direct comparison with AIRS products. We found that satellite-based Ts is lower than Ta over the forest area, but higher than Ta over the non-forest area. Nevertheless, the correlation coefficients (R) between monthly Ta and four Ts products during 2003–2016 are greater than 0.8 over most stations. The long-term trend analysis shows a general warming trend in temperatures, particularly over the central and eastern parts of Brazil. The satellite products could also observe the increasing Ts over the deforestation region. Furthermore, we examined the temperature anomalies during three drought events in the dry season of 2005, 2010, and 2015. All products show similar spatio-temporal patterns, with positive temperature anomalies expanding in areal coverage and magnitude from the 2005 to 2015 event. The above results show that satellite-based Ts is sensitive in reflecting environmental changes such as deforestation and extreme climatic events, and can be used as an alternative to Ta for climatological studies. Moreover, the observed differences between Ts and Ta may inform how thermal assumptions can be improved in satellite-based retrievals of soil and vegetation moisture or evapotranspiration.},

ABSTRACT = {Noticeable climate change in recent years is reducing the comfort of public spaces in the urban environment, and is becoming an element of urban policies. The adaptation to climate change requires the development of new design guidelines for the development of public spaces. The appropriate definition of development density, choice of building materials, technologies, planting species, and the used directions is a challenge that depends on local conditions. A representative public space located in the area of a multi-family housing estate built in the second half of the 20th century in Lublin (Poland) was selected for the study. The space has undergone redevelopment twice in the last 10 years. The aim of the study was to determine to what extent the executed and designed changes actually improve the thermal comfort of users. Quantitative and qualitative indicators of the successive phases of the investment were analyzed in the context of projected climate change. The simulation was developed using the ENVI-met version 5.0 software. As a result of the changes made, there has been an improvement in usability and comfort. Five simulations were carried out for the warmest day of the year for one of the public spaces in the city of Lublin. The sensation of PET thermal comfort was investigated for people aged 35 and 75, as a particularly sensitive group. The obtained result proved that the elderly feel higher temperature rates than younger people. In one of the simulations, new plantings were proposed to improve the local microclimate. The material temperatures of paved surfaces were also investigated. The article shows how the local microclimate and people’s desire to stay in a given space can be improved with new tree planting.},

ABSTRACT = {The integration of wind energy into power systems has intensified as a result of the urgency for global energy transition. This requires more accurate forecasting techniques that can capture the variability of the wind resource to achieve better operative performance of power systems. This paper presents an exhaustive review of the state-of-the-art of wind-speed and -power forecasting models for wind turbines located in different segments of power systems, i.e., in large wind farms, distributed generation, microgrids, and micro-wind turbines installed in residences and buildings. This review covers forecasting models based on statistical and physical, artificial intelligence, and hybrid methods, with deterministic or probabilistic approaches. The literature review is carried out through a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and Pajek software. A discussion of the results is carried out, taking as the main approach the forecast time horizon of the models to identify their applications. The trends indicate a predominance of hybrid forecast models for the analysis of power systems, especially for those with high penetration of wind power. Finally, it is determined that most of the papers analyzed belong to the very short-term horizon, which indicates that the interest of researchers is in this time horizon.},

ABSTRACT = {Using solar panels is one of the cleanest ways to generate electricity ever created by mankind. The efficiency of rapidly expanding solar panels decreases during their lifetime for several reasons, such as photodegradation, hot spots, potentially induced degradation, etc. Dirt and debris accumulation on the surface of the solar panels can also significantly contribute to their performance degradation due to the diminishing of the solar radiation reaching their active surfaces. Numerous degradation mitigation methods are cited in the literature. This article briefly outlines these basic measures.},

ABSTRACT = {The agricultural sector contributes approximately 10–20% of the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. Consequently, climate change can negatively affect crop yields and livestock production thus threatening food security, especially in a vulnerable continent like Africa. This review provides an overview of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and their impacts on smallholder farmers in five African countries (Algeria, Senegal, Benin, Nigeria and Zambia). A total of 164 published articles on CSA practices were reviewed. Analysis of extracted data showed that CSA practices are classified as follows: agricultural practices, restoration practices of degraded lands, forest and cropland regeneration practices, practices in the livestock sub-sector, water resources and use of weather and climate information services. Moreover, climate change effects differed alongside strategies adapted from one country to another. Adoption of these strategies was often influenced by financial means put in place by governments, the role of policy legislation, access to climate information and farmers’ intellectual level. To address this deficiency, scientific-outcome-based research should be used to increase the effectiveness of climate adaptation management programs. In conclusion, to enhance the uptake of climate-smart agricultural practices in Africa, this review recommends the use of scientific-research-driven adaptation measures and prioritization of climate change in governments’ agendas.},

ABSTRACT = {Spatiotemporal modal analysis and prediction of tropospheric atmospheric CO concentration in the world and East Asia from 2002 to 2021 using the inversion data of airs sounder. The results show that: The CO concentration in the northern hemisphere is higher than that in the southern hemisphere; from the upper troposphere to the lower troposphere, the CO concentration changes from “∧“ to “√”; the fluctuation range of near surface CO concentration in the northern hemisphere is relatively intense, and the fluctuation range in the southern hemisphere is relatively small. Using MK, Sen slope estimation, and EOF analysis, it is found that CO concentration in the convective middle layer tends to decline in more than 90% of the global area, and the decline rate in the northern hemisphere is significantly higher than that in the southern hemisphere. In East Asia, the CO concentration in the lower tropospheric marine area is significantly lower than that in the land area. The average concentration and decline rate of CO in East Asia is always higher than that in the world; the CO concentration in East Asia is the highest in spring and winter in the lower troposphere; and the CO concentration in East Asia is lower in the northeast and higher in the southeast in the upper troposphere in spring, autumn, and winter, and higher in the northeast and Central Plains in summer. Compared with the three-exponential smoothing model, the prediction error of the VMD-LSTM hybrid model for atmospheric CO concentration is significantly reduced, which indicates that the improved neural network prediction model has higher prediction accuracy. The factors affecting the change of tropospheric CO concentration are not only affected by the ground factors, but also related to indirect factors such as water vapor, methane, and atmospheric temperature in the atmosphere.},

ABSTRACT = {The green financing landscape in Pakistan is evolving, which signifies the need for a comprehensive gap analysis that examines the present status and constraints in supporting green finance in the country. Textile and leather industries are key sectors in Pakistan’s economy and rely heavily on small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Excessive resource use and inadequate environmental management methods pose a significant danger to the sectors’ long-term viability and account for an extreme relevance to the embracement of the circular economy paradigm. Green finance aims to ensure that economic process, safeguarding the environment, and maintaining environmental integrity all grow together. This research used a literature review and interview-based methodology (in which we interviewed more than 20 people representing SME operators, government officials, and banking staff) to examine SME finance, green banking, and demand and supply side constraints to cleaner/sustainable manufacturing in Pakistan’s leather and textile sectors. The research findings show that policy uncertainty and financial short-termism are economic impediments and obstacles that constitute a path-dependent, lock-in, non-linear mechanism. This study found a lack of tailored business advisory and financing for SMEs to learn about and invest in sustainable consumption and production (SCP). Furthermore, many banks in Pakistan also show a strong commitment to the expansion of the State Bank of Pakistan’s Green Banking Guidelines (GBGs). The results also highlight the high value of government assistance for businesses participating in green initiatives and incentives for banking institutions and private limited companies to support and invest in green practices.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the most common problems in wind resource assessment is that measured data are not always available at the site of interest. That is why, in several studies, reanalysis data have been used as an alternative, which, in some cases, have been validated by measured data. Mexico is no exception, since there are not many measurement towers in the country that provide valid records throughout the country. In view of the above, in this study a comparison was made between the measurements observed in six anemometric towers, located in different locations in the United Mexican States; data from the MERRA-2 and ERA-5 reanalysis; and data from the generalized wind climates (GWC), available in the Global Wind Atlas. The study was conducted at 80 m, which is the highest height at which data were recorded on the measurement towers at each site. In the case of the MERRA-2 and ERA-5 data, extrapolation of the data series to 80 m was required. In the case of the towers, a comparison of the two data sets measured at 80 m and the height at which two anemometers were available, was performed. This analysis was supported by Windographer version 4 software designed by the company UL solutions, from which *.tab files were exported at 80 m, which were then imported from the WAsP 10.0 program to perform the microscale modeling. The comparison variable was the mean power density, for which the relative deviations between the measured values and those obtained from the reanalysis data and the GWCs were determined. For a better interpretation of the relative errors calculated, an analysis of the orographic characteristics of all the sites was performed using the roughness index (RIX). The results obtained showed that the behavior of the reanalysis and the GWC data was not homogeneous in the sites studied; therefore, an adequate relationship between the magnitudes of the ΔRIX and the relative deviations was not observed, especially for the ERA5 and GWC. The ERA5 data were the furthest from the measured data, with relative deviations greater than 50% at five of the six sites; however, the MERRA-2 and GWC data were the closest to the measured data. The MERRA-2 data showed deviations of less than 11%, except at the La Venta site, where it was 29.5%—a site where the GWC also had a high deviation of 139.4%. The latter is attributable to the effects caused by the nearby wind farms on the wind flow measured by the La Venta station. In general, the MERRA-2 data are an alternative to performing a pre-analysis of the wind resource in Mexico.},

ABSTRACT = {This study is dedicated to modeling the spatial variation in COVID-19 prevalence using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) when dealing with nonlinear relationships, especially useful for small areas or small sample size problems. We compiled a broad range of socio-demographic, environmental, and climatic factors along with potentially related urban land uses to predict COVID-19 prevalence in rural districts of the Golestan province northeast of Iran with a very high-case fatality ratio (9.06%) during the first year of the pandemic (2020–2021). We also compared the ANFIS and principal component analysis (PCA)-ANFIS methods for modeling COVID-19 prevalence in a geographical information system framework. Our results showed that combined with the PCA, the ANFIS accuracy significantly increased. The PCA-ANFIS model showed a superior performance (R2 (determination coefficient) = 0.615, MAE (mean absolute error) = 0.104, MSE (mean square error) = 0.020, and RMSE (root mean square error) = 0.139) than the ANFIS model (R2 = 0.543, MAE = 0.137, MSE = 0.034, and RMSE = 0.185). The sensitivity analysis of the ANFIS model indicated that migration rate, employment rate, the number of days with rainfall, and residential apartment units were the most contributing factors in predicting COVID-19 prevalence in the Golestan province. Our findings indicated the ability of the ANFIS model in dealing with nonlinear parameters, particularly for small sample sizes. Identifying the main factors in the spread of COVID-19 may provide useful insights for health policymakers to effectively mitigate the high prevalence of the disease.},

ABSTRACT = {Assessing water resources at a large river basin scale is important for having an idea of the water situation and efficient water resources management. What is the most appropriate approach to assess the water resources at a large river basin scale? This paper aims to develop a systematic review on water resources assessment at a large river basin scale, intending to present a new assessment method for the major river basins in Madagascar. This review investigates 40 articles from Google Scholar, Web of Science, and PubMed databases, from 2000 to 2022. This review has demonstrated the necessity of water resources assessment at a large river basin scale in Madagascar. An improvement in the use of multiple GCMs and SWAT models for water resources assessment within the basin was found necessary for appropriate water allocating regimes among upper and lower reaches. Water allocation and water scarcity at the basin level could be addressed by using the inter- and intra-basin approaches. The review concludes that a combination of the SWAT, multiple GCMs, and inter- and intra-basin approaches could be efficiently applied for assessing the water resources at a large basin scale. This review may be of benefit to scientists and water specialists.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate streamflow prediction is significant when developing water resource management and planning, forecasting floods, and mitigating flood damage. This research developed a novel methodology that involves data pre-processing and an artificial neural network (ANN) optimised with the coefficient-based particle swarm optimisation and chaotic gravitational search algorithm (CPSOCGSA-ANN) to forecast the monthly water streamflow. The monthly streamflow data of the Tigris River at Amarah City, Iraq, from 2010 to 2020, were used to build and evaluate the suggested methodology. The performance of CPSOCGSA was compared with the slim mold algorithm (SMA) and marine predator algorithm (MPA). The principal findings of this research are that data pre-processing effectively improves the data quality and determines the optimum predictor scenario. The hybrid CPSOCGSA-ANN outperformed both the SMA-ANN and MPA-ANN algorithms. The suggested methodology offered accurate results with a coefficient of determination of 0.91, and 100% of the data were scattered between the agreement limits of the Bland–Altman diagram. The research results represent a further step toward developing hybrid models in hydrology applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Climate change is impacting Mediterranean basins, bringing warmer climate conditions. The Marganai forest is a natural forest protected under the European Site of Community Importance (Natura 2000), located in Sardinia, an island in the western Mediterranean basin, which is part of the Fluminimaggiore basin. Recent droughts have strained the forest′s resilience. A long-term hydrological database collected from 1922 to 2021 shows that the Sardinian forested basin has been affected by climate change since the middle of the last century, associated with a decrease in winter precipitation and annual runoff, reduced by half in the last century, and an increase of ~1 °C in the mean annual air temperature. A simplified model that couples a hydrological model and a vegetation dynamics model for long-term ecohydrological predictions in water-limited basins is proposed. The model well predicted almost one century of runoff observations. Trees have suffered from the recent warmer climate conditions, with a tree leaf area index (LAI) decreasing systematically due to the air temperature and a vapor pressure deficit (VPD) rise at a rate of 0.1 hPa per decade. Future climate scenarios of the HadGEM2-AO climate model are predicting even warmer conditions in the Sardinian forested basin, with less annual precipitation and higher air temperatures and VPD. Using these climate scenarios, we predicted a further decrease in runoff and tree transpiration and LAI in the basin, with a reduction of tree LAI by half in the next century. Although the annual runoff decreases drastically in the worst scenarios (up to 26%), runoff extremes will increase in severity, outlining future scenarios that are drier and warmer but, at the same time, with an increased flood frequency. The future climate conditions undermine the forest’s sustainability and need to be properly considered in water resources and forest management plans.},

ABSTRACT = {The world faces a once-in-a-century transformation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, adversely affecting farmers’ employment, production practices, and livelihood resilience. Meanwhile, climate change (CC) is a crucial issue limiting agricultural production worldwide. Farmers’ lives, severely affected by extreme weather conditions, are resulting in the reduced production of major economic crops. The CC has drastically influenced the major agricultural sectors of Pakistan, leading to a significant decline in farmers’ living standards and the overall economy. Climate-smart and eco-friendly agricultural practices can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and ameliorate agricultural productivity under extreme environmental conditions. This paper highlights farmers’ autonomous CC adaptation strategies and their influence on cash crop (maize for this study) yield under prevailing circumstances. The current study used a simultaneous equation model to examine the different adaptation impacts on adapters and non-adapters. The survey results of 498 maize farmers in rural Pakistan revealed that growers were aware of the recent CC and had taken adequate adaptive measures to acclimatize to CC. Farmers’ arable land area, awareness level, and information accessibility to CC are the most crucial factors that impart a significant role in their adaptation judgments. However, most growers have inadequate adaptation strategies, including improved irrigation and the utilization of extensive fertilizers and pesticides. Using a simultaneous equation model of endogenous switching regression, the study found that farmers not adapted to CC were negatively affecting maize productivity. Therefore, this study suggests that policymakers pay attention to the countermeasures farmers have not taken to mitigate the impact of CC. In addition, policymakers should deliver appropriate adaptation strategies to assist growers in coping with climate-related natural hazards and ensure farmers’ livelihood security, rural revitalization, and sustainable agricultural development.},

ABSTRACT = {Water is the basis of all life on this planet. Yet, approximately one in seven people in the world do not have access to safe water. Water can become unsafe due to contamination by various organic and inorganic compounds due to various natural and anthropogenic processes. Identifying and monitoring water quality changes in space and time remains a challenge, especially when contamination events occur over large geographic areas. This study investigates recent advances in remote sensing that allow us to detect and monitor the unique spectral characteristics of water quality events over large areas. Based on an extensive literature review, we focus on three critical water quality problems as part of this study: algal blooms, acid mine drainage, and suspended solids. We review the advances made in applications of remote sensing in each of these issues, identify the knowledge gaps and limitations of current studies, analyze the existing approaches in the context of global environmental changes, and discuss potential ways to combine multi-sensor methods and different wavelengths to develop improved approaches. Synthesizing the findings of these studies in the context of the three specific tracks will help stakeholders to utilize, share, and embed satellite-derived earth observations for monitoring and tracking the ever-evolving water quality in the earth’s limited freshwater reserves.},

ABSTRACT = {This article aims to analyze agents’ behavior in a competitive hydrothermal energy market. The idea is to investigate how much the day-to-day behavior of the market can be different from the predictions presented by cost-based models because of the risk perception of each agent (hydroelectric energy producer, in this case) as a participant of the market. The main contribution is in determining the impact on the agents’ revenue in the short-term market due to the variation in the amount of energy generated and the market price, which other methodologies may not be able to capture. For this reason, a case study was made using daily simulations in a given month, observing the strategy and bids of eight hydroelectric agents for a central market operator emulated by an energy price offer simulator called SOPEE. The study reflected qualitative and quantitative examples of how the risk perception and the behavior of each agent can influence market behavior due to the variation in their perceptions of the parameters that form the energy price.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, characterization of the optical and microphysical properties of extremely fresh biomass burning aerosol is presented. This work aims to characterize, for the first time to our knowledge, freshly formed smoke particles observed only a few minutes after they were emitted from a nearby forest fire. The smoke particles were detected by combining passive (sun-photometer) and active (Raman lidar) techniques. On 14 August 2021, an EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network) multi-wavelength Raman lidar and a co-located AERONET sun-photometer in Potenza, South Italy, observed an extremely fresh smoke plume. The lidar measurements, carried out from 22:27 to 02:16 UTC, revealed a thick biomass burning layer below 2.7 km. The particle depolarization ratio at 532 nm was 0.025, and lidar ratios at 355 and 532 nm were, respectively, 40 and 38 sr. The mean value of the Ångström exponent was 1.5. The derived size distribution was bimodal with a peak at 0.13 µm, an effective radius mean value of 0.15 µm, and a single scattering albedo of 0.96 at all wavelengths. The real part of the refractive index was 1.58 and the imaginary was 0.006. The AERONET measurements at 5:34 UTC confirmed the lidar measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {China is rich in wind- and solar-energy resources. In recent years, under the auspices of the “double carbon target,” the government has significantly increased funding for the development of wind and solar resources. However, because wind and solar energy are intermittent and their spatial distribution is uneven, the profits obtained by the developers of wind- and solar-energy resources are unstable and relatively low. For this reason, we analyze in this article the spatiotemporal variations in wind and solar energy resources in China and the temporal complementarity of wind and solar energy by applying a Spearman correlation coefficient based on the Daily Value Dataset of China Surface Climate Data V3.0. Finally, we also strive to harmonize regions where wind and solar resources are less complementary by introducing hydro-energy resources. The results reveal that wind energy and solar energy resources in China undergo large interannual fluctuations and show significant spatial heterogeneity. At the same time, according to the complementarity of wind and solar resources, over half of China’s regions are suitable for the complementary development of resources. Further research shows that the introduction of hydro-energy resources makes it feasible to coordinate and complement the development of wind- and solar-energy resources in areas where the complementarity advantage is not significant. This has a significant effect on increasing the profit generated by the complementary development of two or more renewable resources.},

ABSTRACT = {Apparent temperature (AT) is used to evaluate human comfort and is of great importance for studies on the effects of environmental factors on human health. This study used the daytime heat index (HI) calculated by national surface meteorological stations in China as the AT dependent variable, with August 2020 employed as an example. The daytime fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate (ERA5) data and multi-source data extracted from the stations were used as the independent variables. Due to the presence of multicollinearity among the independent variables, we implemented a multiple stepwise regression model and developed a daily near-surface 1 km HI estimation model. The correlation analysis using the model showed that the coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.89; the mean absolute error (MAE) was 1.49 °C, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 2.08 °C. We also used 10-fold cross-validation to calculate the error between the parameter and predicted values. The R2 of the model was 0.96; the MAE was 1.80 °C, and the RMSE was 2.40 °C. In this month, the mean daily daytime HI was 20.51 °C. According to the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), the areas with more than 20 days of heat stress for one month were largely distributed in the desert areas of northwest China and the coastal areas in southeast China, accounting for 29.98% of the total land area of China. This study improves the spatial resolution and accuracy of HI prediction, thus providing a scientific reference for studying residential environments and the urban heat island effect.},

ABSTRACT = {Crop yield is related to household food security and community resilience, especially in smallholder agricultural systems. As such, it is crucial to accurately estimate within-season yield in order to provide critical information for farm management and decision making. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to assess the most appropriate method, indices, and growth stage for predicting the groundnut yield in smallholder agricultural systems in northern Malawi. We have estimated the yield of groundnut in two smallholder farms using the observed yield and vegetation indices (VIs), which were derived from multitemporal PlanetScope satellite data. Simple linear, multiple linear (MLR), and random forest (RF) regressions were applied for the prediction. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to validate the models. The results showed that (i) of the modelling approaches, the RF model using the five most important variables (RF5) was the best approach for predicting the groundnut yield, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.96 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.29 kg/ha, followed by the MLR model (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.84 kg/ha); in addition, (ii) the best within-season stage to accurately predict groundnut yield is during the R5/beginning seed stage. The RF5 model was used to estimate the yield for four different farms. The estimated yields were compared with the total reported yields from the farms. The results revealed that the RF5 model generally accurately estimated the groundnut yields, with the margins of error ranging between 0.85% and 11%. The errors are within the post-harvest loss margins in Malawi. The results indicate that the observed yield and VIs, which were derived from open-source remote sensing data, can be applied to estimate yield in order to facilitate farming and food security planning.},

ABSTRACT = {This study assesses and evaluates the 40-year (1980–2019) Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications v.2 (MERRA-2) surface solar radiation (SSR) as well as its interdecadal changes (Δ(SSR)) against high quality reference surface measurements from 1397 Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) and 73 Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations. The study is innovative since MERRA-2 (Δ(SSR)) has never been evaluated in the past, while the MERRA-2 SSR fluxes themselves have not been evaluated in such large spatial scale, which is global here, and temporal basis, which counts 40-years. Other novelties of the study are the use of the highest quality BSRN stations, done for the first time in such an evaluation, as well as the use of a greater number of reference-GEBA stations than in other studies. Moreover, the assessment and evaluation in this study are largely based on SSR anomalies, while being done in depth, at spatial scales ranging from the local to global/hemispherical, and separately for land and ocean areas, and at temporal scales spanning intervals from decadal sub-periods to 40 years. Overall, the MERRA-2 deseasonalized SSR anomalies correlate well with either GEBA (R equal to 0.61) and BSRN (R equal to 0.62). The percentage of agreement between the sign of computed GEBA and MERRA-2 Δ(SSR) is equal to 63.4% and the corresponding percentage for MERRA-2 and BSRN is 50%. According to MERRA-2, strong and statistically significant positive Δ(SSR) (Brightening) is found over Europe, Central Africa, Mongolia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and some parts of the tropical oceans. In contrast, large and statistically significant negative Δ(SSR) (Dimming) occurs over the western Tropical Warm Pool, India, Southern East China, Amazonia, stratocumulus covered areas and some parts of oceans. MERRA-2 yields a dimming equal to −0.158 ± 0.005 W/m2/year over the globe from 1980 to 2019. This 40-year dimming, which occurred in both hemispheres, more over ocean than continental areas (−0.195 ± 0.006 and −0.064 ± 0.006 W/m2/year, respectively), underwent decadal scale variations.},

ABSTRACT = {With the foreseen increase in population and the reliance on water as a key input for agricultural production, greater demand will be placed on freshwater supplies. The objective of this work was to present the newly developed Android smartphone application to calculate crop evapotranspiration in real-time to support field-scale irrigation management. As part of the answer to water shortage, we embraced technology by developing AgSAT, a Google Earth Engine-based application that optimizes water use for food production. AgSAT uses meteorological data to calculate daily water requirements using the ASCE-Penman–Monteith method (ETref) and vegetation indices from satellite imagery to derive the basal crop growth coefficient, Kcb. The performance of AgSAT to estimate ETref was assessed using climatic data from 18 meteorological stations distributed over several climatic zones worldwide. ETref estimation through the app showed acceptable results with values of 1.27, 0.9, 0.79, 0.95, and 0.5 for root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (r), modeling efficiency (NSE), concordance index (d), and percentage bias (Pbias), respectively. AgSAT guides gross irrigation requirements for crops and rationalizes water quantities used in agricultural production. AgSAT has been released, is currently in use by research scientists, agricultural producers, and irrigation managers, and is freely accessible from the Google Play and IOS Store and also at agsat.app. Our work is geared towards the development of remote sensing-based technologies that transfer significant benefits to farmers and water-saving efforts.},
