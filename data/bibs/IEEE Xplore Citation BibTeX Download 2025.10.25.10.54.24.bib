  abstract={In this work we used time series modelling for generating synthetic sets of hourly solar irradiance for the city of Petrolina located in the northeastern region of Brazil. The models were obtained for each month and were based on 20 years of satellite data. For each month, four time series structures were investigated: auto regressive, auto regressive integrated, auto regressive moving average and auto regressive integrated moving average. We compare the 48 obtained models by comparing the the mean of the synthetic series with the data set means. Another comparison made to validate the time series model was the square error between the data histogram and the synthetic series histogram. Results show that the different model structures generate the best fitting synthetic data for the studied city. This work describes the process of pre-filtering of the data for finally obtaining the monthly models. It also presents the generated synthetic series for hourly solar irradiation. The process described in this work might be used in the planning phase of a solar farm by generating stochastic data for solar irradiance estimation.},

  abstract={Within the context of clean energy generation, solar radiation forecast is applied for photovoltaic plants to increase maintainability and reliability. Machine learning models applied to solar radiation time series helps to improve forecast results. AutoMLs are becoming very popular for industrial application, because it simplifies some the challenge of finding the best suited model. This work presents three different optimizations of known models applied for solar radiation forecasting, ACOLSTM, ACO-CLSTM and AGMMFF. A methodology was used to obtain the results, with Brazilian INMET hourly scaled data, which were compared to the open sources AutoMLs TPOT, HPSKLEARN and AutoKeras. The obtained results for the presented models is promising for use in automatic solar radiation forecasting systems since ACOLSTM was found to outperform the compared models.},

  abstract={Various studies indicate that Fuzzy Time Series (FTS) methods can obtain high accuracy in a variety of forecasting applciations. However, weighted FTS methods tend to show superiority in contrast to weightless ones. This study exploits the use of Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) technique to generate the rules in the knowledge base for the FTS forecasting method. The proposed hybrid method, named HFCM-FTS, combines High Order Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (HFCM) and High Order Fuzzy Time Series (HOFTS), where the weight matrices associated with the state transitions are learned via the genetic algorithm from the data. The objective of FCM is to find the weight matrices that model the causal relations among the concepts defined in the Universe of Discourse. As a case study, we consider solar energy forecasting with public data for Brazilian solar stations from the year 2012 to 2015. The proposed HFCM-FTS is compared with HOFTS, Weighted High Order FTS (WHOFTS), and Probabilistic Weighted FTS (PWFTS) methods. The experiments also cover the influence of three modeling elements on the accuracy of the presented model including the number of concepts, activation function, and bias. The results show that the HFCM-FTS is able to achieve the best results with a low number of concepts.},

  pages={952-960},
  abstract={This paper presents a method for the generation of synthetic time series of solar radiation with a one-minute time resolution using an automatic cloud classification procedure. Solar radiation data from ground-based measurements are used to determine the correlation between the irradiance and the prevailing cloud classes extracted from satellite images. A specific set of Markov chains for each cloud class is adjusted empirically and used for a stochastic simulation of clear sky index time series. The different models are then combined to convert the irradiance into power output time series of photovoltaic power plants of different sizes. Tests to determine the methodology's performance showed positive results in reproducing the statistical characteristics of observed time series data. Estimates of a selected set of metrics were obtained for several sites in Brazil and allowed the characterization of the solar resource for photovoltaic plants of various sizes and mounting methods considering the generation potential and short-term variability.},

  abstract={This paper presents a methodology for estimating the penetration level of photovoltaic generation in distribution networks, using public data from the Geographic Database of Distributors (BDGD) and time series of solar irradiation from PVGIS. The methodology was applied to the distribution network in the state of São Paulo, which consists of 650 substations and 645 municipalities. The growth of Distributed Generation (DG), particularly solar energy, requires new practices for managing the bidirectional flow of energy. This study develops a approach based on time series to calculate photovoltaic gross generation, considering average irradiation and installed capacity. Additionally, the solar penetration index in substations is calculated by comparing the energy generated with the energy consumed, as well as the installed capacity with peak load. The results contribute to the efficient integration of renewable sources into the São Paulo electrical system.},

  abstract={Among the natural phenomena that happen in the Sun, one that has direct impact on Earth are the solar explosions. These explosions emit an X-ray flux that can be detected and used as an indicative of new explosions. In this work, we evaluated whether X-ray flux time series are suitable as the base dataset for solar flare forecasting. To do so, we applied a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and performed a series of experiments to identify its best parameters and its performance for different forecast horizons. The experiments indicated that X-ray flux time series can be used to forecast solar flares and that MLPs are capable of properly forecasting future values of the time series, even though the average errors increase with wider forecast horizons. Besides, we also observed that qualitative analyses are essential for solar explosion forecasts, and should also be made together with traditional quantitative analyses of the results.},

  abstract={Multi-step solar irradiance forecast is an important part of a successful power grid management. However that forecast can be difficult due to nonlinear patterns and random fluctuation. This work applies statistical and machine learning methods to forecast solar irradiance time series from three different locations of Brazil. The applied models are: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Multi Layer Perceptron neural network (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Taking into account these methods, an ensemble of them is proposed, which has the objective of reducing: the uncertainty of selecting a single model, overfitting, and underfitting. Compared with single models and based on two performance metrics, the ensemble found good overall results when applied in the time series with horizons of 6, 12 and 24 hours ahead.},

  abstract={The massive interconnection of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) generation to the distribution network constitutes a challenge for the operation and planning of distribution network. In this environment, the performance of the distribution network may be affected and a comprehensive analysis of the hosting capacity in the medium and low voltage network is necessary. A quasi-static time-series and short-circuit analysis considering scenarios of PV systems penetration is proposed to accurately capture the effects of resource intermittency and load dynamics. Six metrics are used: overvoltage, voltage unbalance, thermal loading, fault currents, reverse power flow, and network losses. To evaluate the performance of the method, a real distribution feeder is used, as well as characteristic data of the classes of consumers. Since the relevance of a metric in the impact of the operation depends on the particular characteristics of each case, it is convenient to quantify these different metrics.},

  abstract={Alternative energy sources are becoming more and more common around the world. In order to reduce environmental pollution and CO2 emissions, in addition to being an ideal solution to overcome the energy crisis. In this context, power energy stands out, as it is the most abundant and most widely available natural resource on the entire planet. Due to the high level of uncertainty of the factors that directly interfere in the generation of solar power, such as temperature and solar radiation, make predictions of solar power with high precision is a challenge. Thus, the objective of this article is to develop a forecasting model, through time series, that makes it possible to predict the production of power energy, using a database collected in a photovoltaic plant in Uruguay. For the development of the proposal, models (base-learners), pre-processing techniques and models (meta-learners) used in the Stacking-Ensemble Learnig (STACK) method were used, which were compared using the measurements of performance Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE), Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) and Determination Coefficient (R2 ) in addition to statistical tests. In the end, it can be concluded that the combination Correlation Matrix (CORR) and Language Model (LM), from Layer-0 obtained the best results, in the three performance measures and the combination of models (base-learners) and pre-processing techniques (Layer-0) presented the best results when compared to Layer-1, obtaining satisfactory values in all performance measures.},

  abstract={Solar Photovoltaics is a source of energy very sensitive to climate variations. Therefore, it is very important to apply a forecasting method to a PV system. Solar forecasting provides extremely useful information for tasks such as management of electricity grids and solar energy trading, where good accuracy and good performance are desirable goals for a very short term forecasting model. In this paper, we propose the use of fuzzy time series (FTS) techniques to this problem. Specifically, Chen's first order and high-order FTS methods and the Weighted FTS method are compared with other forecasting models widely used to approach solar irradiance forecasting. We evaluate the performance of FTS methods and different forecasting techniques to solve very short-term solar forecasting problems. The results show that FTS methods are able to achieve significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and performance if compared to other forecasting methods. A discussion on how to improve the forecasting performance of FTS models is also provided.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a new pattern mining task that considers aligning or joining a set of time series based on an arbitrary number of subsequences (i.e., patterns) with arbitrary lengths. Joining multiple time series along common patterns can be pivotal in clustering and summarizing large time series datasets. An exact algorithm to join hundreds of time series based on multi-length patterns is impractical due to the high computational costs. This paper proposes a fast algorithm named MultiPAL to join multiple time series at interactive speed to summarize large time series datasets. The algorithm exploits Matrix Profiles of the individual time series to enable a greedy search over possible joins. The algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the exact solution and can utilize hundreds of Matrix Profiles. We evaluate our algorithm for sequential mining on data from various real-world domains, including power management and bioacoustics monitoring.},

  year={2022},
  volume={20},

  pages={250-258},
  abstract={This paper proposes two approaches for modeling solar irradiance time series. The first is an exploratory analysis and second is a periodic forecast model for solar irradiance data from solarimetric station in a country city of Bahia, Brazil. Two normality hypothesis tests were applied, Anderson-Darling and Shapiro-Wilk. The shape and symmetry of the data were also analyzed using boxplot and histograms to investigate the extreme points, as well as great asymmetry in the distribution of data at different times. Through adherence tests, the normal distribution of solar irradiance in most hours within the annual periodic is rejected. A study by season was carried out, which showed a different behavior in relation to the symmetry of the data, with autumn being the most uniform and spring being the most stochastic. Spring and summer presented better conditions for installation of photovoltaic plates, due to the high solar irradiance rates, and autumn and winter presented satisfactory solar irradiance to maintain this form of generation throughout the year.The second approach is a forecast to solar irradiance in photovoltaic generation systems. The importance of this forecast type is to favor the routine of planning, operation and maintenance of these types of systems, in addition to serving as a basis for feasibility studies and expansion of solar generation. Given a stochastic resource and the periodic behavior of solar irradiance data, a periodic autoregressive model was considered; the statistics were used by the maximum likelihood method, based on hourly measurements of irradiance over a period of one year.},

The ESN is trained and tested using two performance metrics (correlation coefficient and mean squared error) on meteorological and solar data recorded at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Solar Radiation Research Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. When feedback of target outputs is utilized, an improvement is seen for the first performance metric, while no significant change is seen for the second performance metric.

  abstract={Solar activity explains a fraction of the variation in incident solar irradiance at the top of atmosphere (ToA). The radiometric calibration of multispectral sensors depends on the exoatmospheric spectral irradiance (ESUN) parameter that quantifies the incidence of energy on the ToA in spectral intervals. Since ESUN values are normalized, they neglect the variability caused by this phenomenon. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the variability of the ToA solar irradiance caused by solar cycles and activities on the computation of the ToA reflectance values of the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/L7 sensor using daily ToA solar irradiance data from the Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM)/Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) instrument. The relative variability in the time series of ToA reflectance was computed during solar cycles number 23 (partially) and 24 (2003–2020). The results indicate that short-term solar activity can affect daily ToA reflectance up to 0.46%, 0.40%, 0.31%, 0.22%, 0.35%, and 2.37% in the blue, green, red, near-infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR)-1, and SWIR-2 bands of the ETM+ sensor, respectively. However, when compared to the upper limits of the long-term uncertainties of ~1.0% (visible (VIS)-NIR), ~1.2% (SWIR-1), and ~1.4% (SWIR-2), it appears that only the larger variations can be considered as due to the Sun’s activity. The intrinsic long-term variations of the solar cycle are below these limits and may be influenced by the uncertainties of the instruments used. We conclude that solar activity is not negligible within radiometric calibration of multispectral sensors, but more accurate ToA solar irradiance data are needed to assess the impact of long-term phenomena.},

  abstract={This paper presents a risk analysis approach of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to renewable energy in Brazil: hydro, wind, and photovoltaic energy. The Monte Carlo method is applied to stochastic models to generate synthetic time series of four random variables: water inflow, wind speed, solar irradiance, and temperature of photovoltaic panel. Probability distribution of the levelized cost of electricity for the three sources are provided and analyzed. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed considering two key parameters: investment expenditure and discount rate, where a comparative analysis between sources is carried out. The results provide important risk information to assist policy makers and investors in the decision-making process.},

  abstract={The safety of critical structures such as dams, are great concern of authorities around the world. Conventionally, systems based on time series analysis method have been used to detect anomalies in order to ensure the safety in the operation of these structures. This paper proposes a supplementary system able to receive messages and alarms coming from the first assessment performed by the main system with the goal to improve its accuracy and assertiveness. The messages and alarms are emitted by a already deployed software and they are joined at more three categories of data coming from other sources in order to create a knowledge base. From the composition of the knowledge base, the supplementary system performs a new inference and outputs a new message that content the original message with further important details about the monitored structure. The new message enables the engineering team to make decisions more fast and accurate in comparision with the original message. Experimental results from a real application validate the proposed method.},

  abstract={Energy consumption is a major issue in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Data prediction methods can improve the lifetime of the network and reduce congestion by reducing the amount of unnecessary data transmission. This paper proposes the use of a Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an attention mechanism for the case of multivariate time series (MTS) prediction in a WSN. First, a basic Seq2Seq model is introduced, and then the Attention mechanism. The model is compared with others using different error metrics in prediction. Finally, a measure of the reduction in data transmission is given, considering different error thresholds. Results show that the model can save a considerable amount of data in transmission and still maintain a good representation of the measured data.},

  abstract={Short-term photovoltaic (PV) energy production forecasting is critical for managing grid-connected systems and energy trading. Machine learning models are widely used for accurate prediction, and this study proposes using Time2Vec as an embedding for a transformer-based neural network architecture. Experiments on two PV power plants in India showed significant improvements comparing our proposed architecture to MLP, LSTM, and the persis-tence model, which is a standard baseline prediction in this type of forecasting, with over 20 % improvements in some horizons. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for short-term PV forecasting using machine learning models.},
