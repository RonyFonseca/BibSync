ABSTRACT = {Global manufacturing economies have faced logistics performance challenges in recent decades. This study investigates the influence of industrialization, environmental technology, trade openness, foreign direct investment, and economic growth on the logistics performance index in the top 20 manufacturing economies from 2007 to 2023. This study used an advanced panel approach to obtain robust results, cross-section dependency, a unit root test and a panel cointegration test. The panel quantile regression (PQL) and panel quantile estimates based on income methods were employed to analyze long-run and short-run estimations. The empirical results show that industrialization accelerated across all the quantiles except at the 10th quantile, while environmental technology had a significantly positive impact on logistics performance across all quantiles (10th–90th). Moreover, our baseline model was further supported by the fact that we used Driscoll–Kraay and Prais–Winsten’s estimates and a panel causality test. Our findings reveal that in manufacturing countries, industrialization, environmental technology, and economic growth have a positive impact on logistics performance. This study proposes several recommendations to improve industrialization and environmental technology in manufacturing countries to promote logistics performance. At the same time, more resources should be allocated for industrialization as well as environmental technologies to promote logistics performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Cotton is a vital economic crop in global agriculture and the textile industry, contributing significantly to food security, industrial competitiveness, and sustainable development. Traditional technologies such as spectral imaging and machine learning improved cotton cultivation and processing, yet their performance often falls short in complex agricultural environments. Deep learning (DL), with its superior capabilities in data analysis, pattern recognition, and autonomous decision-making, offers transformative potential across the cotton value chain. This review highlights DL applications in seed quality assessment, pest and disease detection, intelligent irrigation, autonomous harvesting, and fiber classification et al. DL enhances accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, promoting the modernization of cotton production and precision agriculture. However, challenges remain, including limited model generalization, high computational demands, environmental adaptability issues, and costly data annotation. Future research should prioritize lightweight, robust models, standardized multi-source datasets, and real-time performance optimization. Integrating multi-modal data—such as remote sensing, weather, and soil information—can further boost decision-making. Addressing these challenges will enable DL to play a central role in driving intelligent, automated, and sustainable transformation in the cotton industry.},

ABSTRACT = {The growing complexity and uncertainty in modern power systems—driven by increased integration of renewable energy sources and variable loads—underscore the need for robust tools to assess dynamic stability. This paper presents an enhanced methodology for modal analysis that combines Adaptive Variational Mode Decomposition (A-VMD) with Prony’s method. A novel energy-based selection mechanism is introduced to determine the optimal number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), improving the decomposition’s adaptability and precision. The resulting modes are analyzed to estimate modal frequencies and damping ratios. Validation is conducted using both synthetic datasets and real synchrophasor measurements from Ecuador’s national power grid under ambient and disturbed operating conditions. The proposed approach is benchmarked against established techniques, including a matrix pencil, conventional VMD-Prony, and commercial tools such as WAProtector and DIgSILENT PowerFactory. The results demonstrate that A-VMD consistently delivers more accurate and robust performance, especially for low signal-to-noise ratios and low-energy ambient conditions. These findings highlight the method’s potential for real-time oscillation mode identification and small-signal stability monitoring in wide-area power systems.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a study of the thermal structure, circulation, and mixing processes in an inland water body by taking into account horizontal heterogeneity using a three-dimensional thermohydrodynamics model. The object of this study was the Rybinsk Reservoir, a large inland water body with complex morphology. Field measurement data and ERA5 reanalysis data, as well as a three-dimensional numerical model (which is a development by the authors of this article), were used in this research. The results of the numerical experiments show that three-dimensional numerical modeling, which explicitly takes into account the contribution of seiche oscillations, allows us to describe the temperature distribution in a water body with sufficient accuracy, and this plays a fundamental role in studies of inland water objects. The obtained results could be useful for a model representation of the biochemical processes occurring in lakes and reservoirs. Thus, for models of less spatial detail that are, for example, used to hlrepresent lakes in Earth system models, it is necessary to take into account seiches in the form of parameterizations.},

ABSTRACT = {In the context of climate change, surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) have become critical factors affecting the quality of the urban built environment. However, low-precision satellite thermal infrared remote sensing is suitable for urban scales but is insufficient to reveal the spatiotemporal distribution roles of surface heat islands at the neighborhood scale. This research takes the Sipailou Campus of Southeast University as an example and employs UAV thermal infrared imaging to acquire high-precision surface temperature data. It then systematically investigates the relationship and association mechanism between the surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) and campus 2D/3D landscape configuration. The results indicate that the campus has a cooling effect during the daytime, with an average SUHII of −0.90 °C. It demonstrates the SUHII characteristics for campus land use types are as follows: SUHII_BD > SUHII_IS > SUHII_GS > SUHII_WB. Furthermore, the campus landscape has a significant hierarchical driving effect on SUHII, with the configuration of campus buildings and the impervious surface driving the strong heat island (SHI) and the 3D configuration and structure of greenspace dominantly strengthening the strong cool island (SCI). The overall design strategy of “two-dimensional priority, three-dimensional optimization” enables us to effectively mitigate the campus SUHII. This study reveals the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of campus SUHII and the key influencing factors, and it also broadens the application of UAV thermal infrared imaging technology in the meso–micro-scale urban heat island assessment, providing suggestions for constructing a climate-adaptive urban landscape.},

ABSTRACT = {Conventional approaches to analyzing power losses in electrical transmission networks have largely emphasized generic power loss minimization through the integration of loss-reducing devices such as shunt capacitors. However, achieving optimal power loss minimization requires a more data-driven and intelligent approach that transcends traditional methods. This study presents a novel classification-based methodology for detecting and analyzing transmission line losses using real-world data from the Ikorodu–Sagamu 132 kV double-circuit line in Nigeria, selected for its dense concentration of high-voltage consumers. Twelve (12) transmission lines were examined, and the collected data were subjected to comprehensive preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling. The classification capabilities of advanced deep learning models—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)—were explored through six experimental scenarios: LSTM, LSTM with Attention Mechanism (LSTM-AM), BiLSTM, GRU, LSTM-BiLSTM, and LSTM-GRU. These models were implemented using the Python programming environment and evaluated using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, support, and confusion matrices. Statistical analysis revealed significant variability in transmission losses, particularly in lines such as I1, Ps, Ogy, and ED, which exhibited high standard deviations. The LSTM-AM model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 83.84%, outperforming both standalone and hybrid models. In contrast, BiLSTM yielded the lowest performance. The findings demonstrate that while standalone models like GRU and LSTM are effective, the incorporation of attention mechanisms into LSTM architecture enhances classification accuracy. This study provides a compelling case for employing deep learning-based classification techniques in intelligent power loss classification across transmission networks. It also supports the realization of SDG 7 by aiming to provide access to reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy for all.},

ABSTRACT = {The broad spatiotemporal coverage provided by satellite remote sensing is fundamental for monitoring fog events, a phenomenon that impacts transportation, agriculture, and ecosystem functioning. Despite advances in remote sensing technology, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the application of these techniques to fog detection, especially over terrestrial ecosystems. This scoping review synthesizes the trends in methods used for fog detection by analyzing 38 papers retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science. Only studies that utilized satellite imagery to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of fog were included. Articles that employed non-satellite methodologies or focused on processes other than the detection, formation, or identification of fog events were excluded. In addition to a term co-occurrence analysis of abstracts using VOSviewer, this study examines key parameters of the detection methods—including sensor type, spectral bands, temporal resolution, and algorithmic approaches (e.g., threshold methods and deep learning techniques)—to evaluate their evolution and current limitations. Our results reveal that while approximately 53% of studies rely on geostationary satellite data (95% CI: 36.7–68.5%), favored for their high temporal resolution, the remaining 47% employ polar-orbiting sensors (95% CI: 31.5–63.2%) that offer superior spatial resolution. Notably, most research has concentrated on maritime fog detection, with few studies extending these techniques to complex terrestrial environments. The review highlights critical gaps in current approaches and proposes an integrated framework that combines traditional brightness temperature difference methods with emerging machine learning techniques, which could advance fog detection in diverse settings.},

ABSTRACT = {This study probes the complex interplay between tourism development (TDI), economic growth (GDP), and environmental sustainability, focusing on the ten most influential tourism nations: China, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Germany, Turkey, Spain, the United States, and Russia, covering the time from 1994 to 2023. This study uses feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) and Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) together with Driscoll–Kraay (DK) and panel quantile regression (PaQR) to examine the environmental as well as economic effects of TDI combined with trade openness (TOPE), foreign direct investment (FDI), energy prices (EPS), and population density (POPD). All models show that tourism development, indicated by TDI, and economic growth increase carbon emissions, demonstrating these variables’ adverse environmental impact. Energy prices, trade openness, and foreign direct investment lead to decreased emissions because these factors help promote energy-efficient clean technology. Furthermore, GDP growth positively influences TDI, while excessive carbon emissions negatively impact the appeal of tourism. The results indicate the need for sustainable tourism policies and investment in clean energy and green infrastructure, aligned with SDG 9, to foster innovation in energy-efficient practices and infrastructure. The research also supports SDG 13 by advocating climate-resilient tourism models and policies that decouple economic growth from environmental degradation. By adopting various advanced econometric approaches, this study provides strong evidence on the relationship between tourism, the macroeconomy, and environmental results. It offers fresh insights on how to achieve the growth of tourism and climate protection at the world’s top tourist destinations.},

ABSTRACT = {Considering that nowadays the economy plays a crucial role, time series forecasting has become an essential tool across various economic areas and industries. The process of predicting future trends based on historical values in a reliable and accurate manner has generated numerous benefits, such as simplified decision-making processes or strategic planning and reduced risk management. Furthermore, with the advancement made through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, time series forecasting has quickly become more precise, adaptive, and scalable, being able to better overcome real-world challenges. In this context, the present paper analyzes the implications of artificial intelligence in time series forecasting by evaluating the scientific articles from the field indexed in Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science Core Collection database. Through a bibliometric approach, the research identifies key journals, affiliations, authors, and countries, as well as the collaboration networks among authors and countries. It also analyzes the most frequently used keywords and authors’ keywords. The annual growth rate of 23.11% indicates sustained interest among researchers. Prominent journals such as IEEE Access, Energies, Mathematics, Applied Sciences—Basel, and Applied Energy have been the home for the most published papers in this field. Further, thanks to the Biblioshiny library in R, a variety of visualizations have been created, including thematic maps, three-field plots, and word clouds. A comprehensive review of the most cited papers has been performed to highlight the role of AI in time series forecasting. Research results and methods confirmed the versatility of the topics, which have been applied in various fields, such as, but not limited to, finance, energy, climate, and healthcare, and are further discussed. Cutting-edge methodologies and approaches that lead to the transformation of the field of time series analysis in the context of AI are uncovered and discussed through the use of thematic maps.},

ABSTRACT = {To build climate-resilient livestock systems, public policies must be informed by bioclimatic zoning, enabling region-specific interventions and more efficient resource allocation. This study aimed to conduct bioclimatic zoning for dairy cattle farming in the state of Maranhão, Brazil. Big data analysis techniques and predictive geostatistical modeling were applied to historical (2012–2023) and future climate scenarios under intermediate (RCP4.5) and high-intensity (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emissions. Kriging maps of THI revealed a decreasing north–south thermal gradient, with values exceeding 80 during critical years. Milk yield losses were more pronounced in high-producing cows, reaching up to 5 kg/cow/day under extreme heat. Areas identified as drought-prone exhibited spatial patterns consistent with THI distributions. The projections indicate that, under the RCP 4.5 scenario, over 60% of Maranhão will exhibit average THI values between 78 and 81 by the end of the century. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, large areas of the state are expected to reach THI values above 86. Under these conditions, estimated milk production losses may exceed 4 kg/cow/day for moderate-yielding animals and 9 kg/cow/day for high-yielding ones, respectively. The results reinforce the importance of bioclimatic zoning to support informed policymaking in the context of climate change.},

ABSTRACT = {Surface water systems face unprecedented stress due to climate variability, urbanization, land-use change, and growing water demand—prompting a shift from traditional hydrological modeling to intelligent, adaptive systems. This review critically explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in surface flow management, encompassing applications in streamflow forecasting, sediment transport, flood prediction, water quality monitoring, and infrastructure operations such as dam and irrigation control. Drawing from over two decades of interdisciplinary literature, this study synthesizes recent advances in machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), the Internet of Things (IoT), remote sensing, and hybrid AI–physics models. Unlike earlier reviews focusing on single aspects, this paper presents a systems-level perspective that links AI technologies to their operational, ethical, and governance dimensions. It highlights key AI techniques—including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Transformer models, and Reinforcement Learning—and discusses their strengths, limitations, and implementation challenges, particularly in data-scarce and climate-uncertain regions. Novel insights are provided on Explainable AI (XAI), algorithmic bias, cybersecurity risks, and institutional readiness, positioning this paper as a roadmap for equitable and resilient AI adoption. By combining methodological analysis, conceptual frameworks, and future directions, this review offers a comprehensive guide for researchers, engineers, and policy-makers navigating the next generation of intelligent surface flow management.},

ABSTRACT = {Efficient utilization of wind energy resources, including advances in weather and seasonal forecasting and climate projections, is imperative for the sustainable progress of wind power generation. Although temperature and precipitation data receive considerable attention in interannual variability and seasonal forecasting studies, there is a notable gap in exploring correlations between climate indices and wind speeds. This paper proposes the use of an ensemble of artificial neural networks to forecast wind speeds based on climate oscillation indices and assesses its performance. An initial examination indicates a correlation signal between the climate indices and wind speeds of ERA5 for the selected case study in eastern Canada. Forecasts are made for the season April–May–June (AMJ) and are based on most correlated climate indices of preceding seasons. A pointwise forecast is conducted with a 20-member ensemble, which is verified by leave-on-out cross-validation. The results obtained are analyzed in terms of root mean squared error, bias, and skill score, and they show competitive performance with state-of-the-art numerical wind predictions from SEAS5, outperforming them in several regions. A relatively simple model with a single unit in the hidden layer and a regularization rate of 10−2 provides promising results, especially in areas with a higher number of indices considered. This study adds to global efforts to enable more accurate forecasting by introducing a novel approach.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the scientific community has intensified its efforts to develop a new type of concentrator photovoltaic module that is competitive with conventional modules. These modules are based on internal tracking systems, known as micro-tracking concentrator photovoltaic modules, which generate electrical energy proportional to the direct radiation on the inclined surface. There are several reviews, databases, and models for various components of solar radiation, particularly for global and direct normal radiation. However, readily available data on direct inclined irradiance remain scarce. This paper reviews several available sources of solar radiation data, finding that only the Photovoltaic Geographic Information System and Solar Radiation Database provide direct inclined irradiance data. A comparative statistical analysis was carried out, and a reasonable fit was obtained between both databases. In addition, direct inclined radiation data extracted from these databases were compared with the values calculated using a well-established mathematical model. In addition, worldwide maps were generated to determine areas of interest for this technology. Therefore, this paper presents an original comparative analysis of existing databases containing information on direct inclined irradiation. This information is of interest for the accurate design and performance analysis of micro-tracking concentrator modules.},

ABSTRACT = {Droughts in the Amazon region are expected to increase in frequency and intensity, which would negatively affect the tropical forest, leading to a positive climate–forest feedback loop that could potentially result in the collapse of this ecosystem. In this study, extreme drought conditions were identified in the Peruvian Amazon region for the period 2000–2024 using the maximum cumulative water deficit (MCWD) index, which is related to the tropical forest water stress. The ERA5, CHIRPS, and MSWEP datasets were used to estimate precipitation, while ERA5 data were used for evapotranspiration. This study focuses on the specificities of droughts and the differences across study areas. Six study areas were specified, three of them located in the Loreto department (northern Peruvian Amazon), another centered in Moyobamba city (western Peruvian Amazon), another in Ucayali, in the central Peruvian Amazon, and the other in Madre de Dios (southern Peruvian Amazon). It was found that the drought events are more frequent and intense in the central and southern regions of the basin. Based on the combined effect of the regional severity of the drought and its spatial extent, estimated from averaging across study areas and precipitation datasets, we identified the hydrological years of 2023-24, 2022-23, 2009-10, and 2004-05 as extreme droughts and 2015-16 and 2006-07 as moderate droughts.},

ABSTRACT = {This study examines the impact of technological innovation, digitalization, and information and communication technologies (ICTs) on trade-related carbon emissions (TAEs) and the role of economic growth in this relationship. Using data from the 15 countries with the highest carbon emissions in the world for the period 1997–2022, analyses were conducted with Panel-Corrected Standard Errors (PCSEs), Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR), and Driscoll–Kraay (D-K) estimators. TAEs provide a more comprehensive environmental assessment than traditional emission calculations by taking into account the impact of international trade on carbon emissions. The findings show that technological innovation, digitalization, and ICTs use increased trade-related carbon emissions, and economic growth further strengthens this effect. These results reveal that sustainable production models and green energy policies should be emphasized more in order to minimize the environmental impacts of technological developments and economic growth. The findings of this study provide important strategic information for policymakers, environmental regulators, and international trade institutions in developing sustainable technology and trade policies to reduce carbon emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {Brazil is increasingly affected by extreme weather events due to climate change, with pronounced regional differences in temperature and precipitation patterns. The southeast region is particularly vulnerable, frequently experiencing severe droughts and extreme heatwaves linked to atmospheric blocking events and intense rainfall episodes driven by the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). These phenomena contribute to recurring climate-related disasters. The country’s heavy reliance on hydropower heightens its susceptibility to droughts, while growing evidence points to intensifying dry spells and wildfires across multiple regions, threatening agricultural output and food security. Urban areas, particularly, are experiencing more frequent and severe heatwaves, posing serious health risks to vulnerable populations. This study investigates the links between global teleconnection indices and synoptic-scale systems, specifically blocking events and SACZ activity, and their influence on Brazil’s extreme heat, drought conditions, and river flow variability over the past 30 to 40 years. By clarifying these interactions, the research aims to enhance understanding of how large-scale atmospheric dynamics shape climate extremes and to assess their broader implications for water resource management, energy production, and regional climate variability.},

ABSTRACT = {Estimating the actual evapotranspiration (ETc act) of cropland in arid areas, exploring the time trend, and analyzing periodic variation are the key to long-term assessment of water resource availability and regional drought. The Penman formula has a strong ability to characterize reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo). However, the application of this formula may be limited in the absence of a complete set of climate data. While previous studies have investigated Kc act in China, few have employed localized Kc values to systematically analyze long-term periodic fluctuations in ETc act under climate variability conditions. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the applicability of nine ETo estimation models in the Loess Plateau of China, calculate actual crop coefficients (Kc act) for spring maize and winter wheat, and examine the temporal trend and periodicity of ETc act for long-term (1961–2018) continuous cropping of spring maize and winter wheat in the study area. The Mann–Kendall test and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) were used to obtain the temporal trend and periodicity of ETc act. The results were as follows: (1) Priestley–Taylor (Prs–Tylr), based on radiation, and the 1985 Hargreaves–Samani (Harg), based on temperature, can be used when meteorological data are limited. It should be noted that among the models evaluated in this study, except for FAO56-PM, only the Harg equation is compatible with Kc-ETo due to established conversion factors. (2) The Kc act of spring maize at the seeding–jointing stage and the earning–filling stage was 12% and 10% lower than the value recommended by FAO, respectively. For Kc act of winter wheat, it was 65% higher, 31% lower, and 85% higher than the FAO experience values in the rejuvenation–jointing stage, heading–grouting stage, and grouting–harvest stage. (3) Winter wheat, through its ETc act cycle synchronized with precipitation and excellent water balance, can effectively alleviate regional drought. It is recommended to be included in the promotion of drought resistance policies.},

ABSTRACT = {As a major contributor to global energy consumption and carbon emissions, the building sector plays a pivotal role in achieving carbon peaking and neutrality targets. This study systematically reviews the evolution of research on building stock energy conservation and emission reduction (BSECER) from 1992 to 2025, which is based on a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 2643 publications. The analysis highlights the research contributions of countries, institutions, and scholars in the BSECER field, reveals patterns in collaborative networks, and identifies the development and shifting focus of research topics over time. The findings indicate that current BSECER research centers around four main areas: behavioral efficiency optimization, full life cycle carbon management, urban system transformation, and the integration of intelligent technologies, which collectively form a multiscale emission reduction framework from individual behavior to large-scale systems. Building on these insights, this study outlines five key future research directions: advancing comprehensive carbon neutrality technologies, accelerating the engineering application of intelligent technologies, developing innovative multi-scenario policy simulation tools, overcoming integration challenges in renewable energy systems, and establishing an interdisciplinary platform that links health, behavior, and energy conservation.},

ABSTRACT = {Predicting global ionospheric total electron content (TEC) is critical for high-precision GNSS applications, but some existing models fail to jointly capture spatial heterogeneity and multiscale temporal trends. To address the problem, this work proposes a spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) that addresses these limitations through (1) a trainable positional attention mechanism to dynamically infer node dependencies without fixed geographical constraints and (2) a GRU–Transformer sequential module to hierarchically model local and global temporal patterns. The proposed network is validated by different solar and geomagnetic activities. With a training dataset with a time span between 2008 and 2018, the proposed model is tested in a high solar phase for the year 2015 and a low solar phase for the year 2018. For 2015, the experimental results show a 21.9% RMSE reduction at low latitudes compared to the results of the iTransformer model. For the geomagnetic storm event, the proposed STGNN achieves 16.0% higher stability. For the one-week (84 step) prediction test, the STGNN shows a 27.0% lower error compared to the MLPMultivariate model. The model’s self-adaptive spatial learning and multiscale temporal modeling uniquely enable TEC forecasting under diverse geophysical conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {This study analyzes the spatial and temporal variability of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, based on short-term sampling campaigns conducted in 2019 and 2022. In 2019, PM10 levels averaged 38.14 µg/m3, while in 2022 they rose significantly to 62.18 µg/m3. PM2.5 in 2022 averaged 30.37 µg/m3. These differences are likely influenced by meteorological variability, including increased transport of Saharan dust in mid-2022, and seasonal factors. Although local emission changes were not directly assessed, they may have also played a role in the observed trends. Statistical analyses revealed that aerosol optical depth (AOD), air pressure, and rainfall were significant predictors of PM10 in 2022, explaining up to 75% of the variance. Correlations and regression models confirmed a robust association between AOD and PM levels on a weekly timescale. These findings highlight the importance of integrating remote sensing and meteorological data to improve air quality monitoring and inform environmental policy in Caribbean urban areas.},

ABSTRACT = {Bias correction of global climate model (GCM) simulations is usually required for hydrological impact studies due to the coarse resolution and systematic biases of these simulations. Commonly used bias correction methods are applied at sites independently while ignoring the spatial correlation of variables, which may cause unreasonable hydrological simulation. To solve this problem, a stochastic multisite bias correction (SMBC) method is proposed for hydrological impact studies. It first uses the Daily Bias Correction (DBC) method to correct the distribution of variables, and then the distribution-free shuffle algorithm and Markov chain are used to generate spatial correlation of variables. The performance of this method is compared with the DBC method for hydro-meteorological impact studies in the Xiangjiang River Basin. The results show that the DBC method inherits the bias of the temporal sequence of precipitation and spatial correlation of GCM simulated variables. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the spatial correlation is between 0.25 and 0.38 and between 0.36 and 0.39 for the simulated precipitation occurrence and daily precipitation amount, respectively, while the MAE for the probability of two stations having wet days/dry days simultaneously is around 0.07. The SMBC method effectively reproduces spatial correlation of observations, with the MAE of the above indexes around 0.02. In hydrological simulation, the SMBC method has much better performance in reproducing the return period of the maximum consecutive day for streamflow and the maximum consecutive day’s streamflow. The averaged streamflow process is also well represented. Overall, the SMBC method efficiently reproduces the distribution and spatial correlation of variables, thereby generating more accurate hydrology simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {Coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever), caused by Coccidioides spp., is a fungal infection endemic to semi-arid regions of the Americas. Despite 80 years of disease recognition in New Mexico, there is limited disease awareness. We incorporated clinical, epidemiological, and ecological datasets to summarize the knowledge of Valley fever in New Mexico. We analyzed 1541 human cases from 2006 to 2023. On average, 86 cases were reported each year (4.1 cases per 100,000 population per year). The highest levels of incidence were in southwestern New Mexico. American Indian or Alaska Natives in New Mexico had a 1.9 times higher incidence rate of coccidioidomycosis than White people, and among age groups, older populations in New Mexico had the highest incidence rates. We analyzed 300 soil samples near Las Cruces, New Mexico, for the presence of Coccidioides and reported the first known positive soil samples collected from the state, the majority of which were from grassland-dominated sites and from animal burrows. Sequence analyses in clinical specimens, wild animals, and soil samples confirmed that Coccidioides posadasii is the main causative species of coccidioidomycosis in New Mexico. Environmental surveillance validated that locally acquired infections could occur in, but are not limited to, Catron, Doña Ana, Sierra, and Socorro Counties.},

ABSTRACT = {Reliable and accurate solar radiation (SR) prediction is crucial for renewable energy development amid a growing energy crisis. Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly recognized for their ability to provide accurate and efficient solutions to SR prediction challenges. This paper presents an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model optimized using feature selection techniques based on Explainable AI (XAI) methods to enhance SR prediction performance. The developed ANN model is evaluated using a publicly available SR dataset, and its prediction performance is compared with five other ML models. The results indicate that the ANN model surpasses the other models, confirming its effectiveness for SR prediction. Two XAI techniques, LIME and SHAP, are then used to explain the best-performing ANN model and reduce its complexity by selecting the most significant features. The findings show that prediction performance is improved after applying the XAI methods, achieving a lower MAE of 0.0024, an RMSE of 0.0111, a MAPE of 0.4016, an RMSER of 0.0393, a higher R2 score of 0.9980, and a PC of 0.9966. This study demonstrates the significant potential of XAI-driven feature selection to create more efficient and accurate ANN models for SR prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {Crop water use (ETc) is typically estimated as the product of crop evapotranspiration (ETo) and a crop coefficient (Kc). However, the estimation of ETo requires various meteorological data, which are often unavailable or of poor quality, particularly in countries such as Guinea-Bissau, where the maintenance of weather stations is frequently inadequate. The present study aimed to assess alternative approaches, as outlined in the revised FAO56 guidelines, for estimating ETo when only temperature data is available. These included the use of various predictors for the missing climatic variables, referred to as the Penman–Monteith temperature (PMT) approach. New approaches were developed, with a particular focus on optimizing the predictors at the cluster level. Furthermore, different gridded weather datasets (AgERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis) were evaluated for ETo estimation to overcome the lack of ground-truth data and upscale ETo estimates from point to regional and national levels, thereby supporting water management decision-making. The results demonstrate that the PMT is generally accurate, with RMSE not exceeding 26% of the average daily ETo. With regard to shortwave radiation, using the temperature difference as a predictor in combination with cluster-focused multiple linear regression equations for estimating the radiation adjustment coefficient (kRs) yielded accurate results. ETo estimates derived using raw (uncorrected) reanalysis data exhibit considerable bias and high RMSE (1.07–1.57 mm d−1), indicating the need for bias correction. Various correction methods were tested, with the simple bias correction delivering the best overall performance, reducing RMSE to 0.99 mm d−1 and 1.05 mm d−1 for AgERA5 and MERRA-2, respectively, and achieving a normalized RMSE of about 22%. After implementing bias correction, the AgERA5 was found to be superior to the MERRA-2 for all the studied sites. Furthermore, the PMT outperformed the bias-corrected reanalysis in estimating ETo. It was concluded that PMT-ETo can be recommended for further application in countries with limited access to ground-truth meteorological data, as it requires only basic technical skills. It can also be used alongside reanalysis data, which demands more advanced expertise, particularly for data retrieval and processing.},

ABSTRACT = {Although China has achieved substantial reductions in particulate matter pollution, continually rising ground-level ozone now constitutes the primary challenge to further air-quality improvements. A systematic assessment of the long-term spatiotemporal behavior of ozone (O3) and its links to meteorology and emissions is still lacking. Here, we develop a novel framework that couples Kolmogorov–Zurbenko (KZ) filtering with an optimized random forest (RF) regression model to examine daily maximum 8 h average ozone (O3-8h) in 372 Chinese cities from 2013 to 2023. The approach quantitatively disentangles meteorological and emission contributions at the national scale, overcoming the limitations of traditional linear methods in capturing non-linear processes. Long-term components explain, in general, <40% of total O3 variance. In eastern urban agglomerations, long-term meteorological factors—particularly temperature and surface ultraviolet radiation—account for up to 80% of the trend, whereas long-term emission contributions remain modest (≈5–6%), with pronounced signals in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei and Fenwei Plain regions. Empirical orthogonal function analysis further reveals distinct spatial patterns of emission influence: long-term O3 trends in mega-cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai are driven mainly by local emissions (1.5–3% contribution), while key transport hubs including Xi’an, Tangshan, and Langfang are markedly affected by traffic-related emissions (>2%). These findings clarify the heterogeneous mechanisms governing O3 formation across China and provide a scientific basis for designing and implementing the next phase of region-specific, joint prevention-and-control policies.},

ABSTRACT = {Forest carbon sink (FCS) is essential for achieving carbon neutrality and supporting sustainable development in ecologically fragile, resource-based cities such as those on the Loess Plateau. Despite the success of national afforestation programs, economic valuations of FCS at the city level remain limited. This study develops an integrated framework combining carbon stock estimation, regional carbon pricing, and net present value (NPV)-based valuation. Using Shenmu City in Shaanxi Province as a case study, forest carbon stocks from 2010 to 2023 are estimated based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Future stocks (2024–2060) are projected using the GM (1,1) model. A dynamic pricing mechanism with a government-guaranteed floor price is applied under three offset scenarios (5%, 10%, 15%). The results show that Shenmu’s forest carbon stock could reach 20.67 million tonnes of CO2 by 2060, and under a 15% offset scenario, the peak NPV reaches CNY 4.02 billion. Higher offset ratios increase FCS value by 18–22%, reflecting the growing scarcity of carbon credits. The pricing model improves market stability and investor confidence. This study provides a replicable approach for carbon sink valuation in semi-arid areas and offers policy insights aligned with SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land).},

It evaluates their carbon mitigation potential, energy efficiency, and economic feasibility, emphasizing the importance of catalyst selection, carbon dioxide capture techniques, and reactor optimization. The role of real-time monitoring via sensors and predictive modeling through artificial intelligence (AI) is highlighted as critical for enhancing process control and sustainability. Case studies and recent advances are discussed to outline future pathways for integrating thermal treatment with circular economy principles.

ABSTRACT = {The characteristics and types of the sky can greatly influence photovoltaic (PV) power generation, potentially leading to a reduction in both the lifespan and efficiency of the entire system. Driven by the challenge of addressing fluctuations in solar PV energy utilization, the aim was to assess the solar energy potential by analyzing the clear sky index Kt* across elevation profiles. To achieve this, a theoretical model for determining Kt* was employed, which encapsulated the solar energy analysis. Initially, solar energy data collected from approximately 16 stations in various provinces of Mozambique, as part of the solar energy measurement initiatives by INAM, FUNAE, AERONET, and Meteonorm, was processed. Subsequently, the clear sky radiation was calculated, and Kt* was established. The statistical findings indicate a reduction in energy contribution from the predictors, accounting for 28% of the total incident energy; however, there are progressive increases averaging around ~0.02, with Kt* values ranging from 0.4 to 0.9, demonstrating a strong correlation between 0.7 and 0.9 across several stations and predictor parameters. No significant climate change effects were noted. The radiation flux is directed from areas with higher Kt* to those with lower values, as illustrated in the heat map. The region experiences an increase in atmospheric parameter deposition, with concentrations around ~0.20, yet there remains a substantial energy flow potential of 92% for PV applications. This interaction can also be applied in other locations to assess the potential for available solar energy, as the analyzed solar energy spectrum aligns closely with the theoretical statistical calibration of energy distribution relevant to the global solar energy population process.},

ABSTRACT = {Today’s environmental issues are among the primary themes that researchers explore in their search for practical solutions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable practices. Renewable energy is crucial to overcoming future challenges, causing many countries to accelerate their adoption at various levels. In this context, the impact of renewable energy adoption on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the Ha’il region has been evaluated. Specifically, two techniques are employed. The first technique is an empirical model based on the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), which identifies the SDGs related to renewable energy in achieving SDGH. Only three SDGs (SDG7, SDG12, and SDG13) were found to influence SDGH significantly. The second technique uses deep learning, specifically LSTM networks, to forecast SDGH behavior over a ten-year period about the three selected SDGs. The results indicate that these three SDGs play a crucial role in sustainable development in the Ha’il region. Therefore, this research produces strategic recommendations to optimize the adoption of renewable energy in the Ha’il region. These findings provide policymakers with a data-driven framework to enhance strategies, utilize resources more efficiently, and promote broader sustainability initiatives.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents an optimization framework for a utility-scale hybrid power plant (HPP) that integrates wind power plants (WPPs), solar power plants (SPPs), and battery energy storage systems (BESS) using historical and probabilistic weather modeling, regulatory incentives, and multi-objective trade-offs. By employing multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), the study simultaneously optimizes three key objectives: economic performance (maximizing net present value, NPV), system reliability (minimizing loss of power supply probability, LPSP), and operational efficiency (reducing curtailment). The optimized HPP (283 MW wind, 20 MW solar, and 500 MWh BESS) yields an NPV of $165.2 million, a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $0.065/kWh, an internal rate of return (IRR) of 10.24%, and a 9.24-year payback, demonstrating financial viability. Operational efficiency is maintained with <4% curtailment and 8.26% LPSP. Key findings show that grid imports improve reliability (LPSP drops to 1.89%) but reduce economic returns; higher wind speeds (11.6 m/s) allow 27% smaller designs with 54.6% capacity factors; and tax credits (30%) are crucial for viability at low PPA rates (≤$0.07/kWh). Validation via Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) confirms robustness. The study improves hybrid power plant design by combining weather predictions, policy changes, and optimizing three goals, providing a flexible renewable energy option for reducing carbon emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {High ozone (O3) concentrations are frequently recorded in São Paulo Megacity, with extreme O3 levels often linked to high temperatures and heatwaves, phenomena expected to intensify with climate change. The co-occurrence of extreme O3 and heatwaves poses amplified risks to environmental and human health. Hence, this study aims to analyze individual and compound extreme O3 and heatwave events and assess the associated atmospheric patterns. Hourly O3 and temperature (T) data from 20 sites (1998–2023) were used to calculate the maximum daily 8 h average O3 (MD8A-O3) and maximum daily temperature (Tmax). The Mann–Kendall test identified trends for these variables. The 90th percentile of data from September to March defined thresholds for extreme events. Events were classified as extreme when MD8A-O3 and Tmax exceeded their thresholds for at least six consecutive days. ERA5 data were used to evaluate atmospheric patterns during these events. The results show positive trends in MD8A-O3 in 62% of sites, with values exceeding WHO Air Quality Guidelines, alongside positive Tmax trends in 90% of sites. Over the study period, four compound events, seven heatwaves, and four extreme O3 events were identified. Compound and individual events were associated with the South America Subtropical Anticyclone and positive temperature anomalies. Individual O3 events were linked to cold anomalies south of 30° S and positive geopotential height anomalies at 850 hPa. These findings highlight the increasing occurrence of extreme O3 and heatwaves in São Paulo and their atmospheric drivers, offering insights to enhance awareness, forecasting, and policy responses to mitigate health and environmental impacts.},

ABSTRACT = {In the current configuration of Brazil’s hydro-thermal-wind power system, hydroelectric reservoirs have progressively lost their long-term regulatory role due to inadequate planning, inefficient energy use, and reduced inflows. In the context of the energy transition and the incorporation of low-emission technologies into the generation mix, this study proposes expanding nuclear baseload capacity as a “regulatory thermal buffer” to mitigate hydrological uncertainty and strengthen grid stability. Using the São Francisco River basin as a case study, an equivalence factor is developed to relate nuclear energy output to stored hydropower reservoir volume. Results show that nuclear generation can help restore the multi-annual regulatory capacity of Brazil’s hydropower system and enhance the resilience of the National Interconnected System by contributing substantial inertia to an increasingly variable, renewable-based grid.},

ABSTRACT = {The accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) and its components are vital for water resource management and irrigation planning. This study models tree transpiration (T) and ET for grapefruit, litchi, and mango orchards using light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM) optimized using the Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Grounds T and ET for these crops were measured using the heat ratio method of monitoring sap flow and the eddy covariance technique for quantifying ET. The Sentinel 2 satellite was used to compute field leaf area index (LAI). The modelled data were used to partition the orchard ET into beneficial (T) and non-beneficial water uses (orchard floor evaporation—Es). We adopted the 10-fold cross-validation to test the model robustness and an independent validation to test performance on unseen data. The 10-fold cross-validation and independent validation on ET and T models produced high accuracy with coefficient of determination (R2) ≥ 0.88, Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) ≥ 0.91, root mean square error (RMSE) ≤ 0.04 mm/h, and mean absolute error (MAE) ≤ 0.03 mm/h for all the crops. The study demonstrates that LightGBM can accurately model the transpiration and evapotranspiration for subtropical tree crops using Sentinel 2 data. The study found that Es which combined soil evaporation and understorey vegetation transpiration contributed 35, 32, and 31% to the grapefruit, litchi and mango orchard evapotranspiration, respectively. We conclude that improvements on orchard floor management practices can be utilized to minimize non-beneficial water losses while promoting the productive water use (T).},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning (ML) has gained significant attention for unraveling the complex, nonlinear relationships between soil moisture (SM) and various predictive variables, including remote sensing (RS; reflectance, brightness temperature, backscatter coefficients) and biophysical (topographic, soil, vegetation, and weather) variables. We reviewed the literature to extract and synthesize ML algorithms, reliable input features, and challenges in SM estimation using RS data. We analyzed results from 144 articles published from 2010 to 2024. Random forest (40 out of 67 studies), support vector regressor (13 out of 39 studies), and artificial neural networks (12 out of 27 studies) often outperformed other algorithms to estimate SM using RS datasets. Multi-source RS data often outperformed single-source data in SM estimation. Satellite-derived features, such as vegetation indices and backscattering coefficients, provided critical information on surface SM (SSM) variability to estimate SSM. For root zone SM estimation, soil properties and SSM generally were more reliable predictors than surface information derived solely from RS. Two recent advances—the use of semi-empirical models and L-band SAR to mitigate vegetation effects, and transfer learning to improve model transferability—have shown promise in addressing key challenges in SM estimation.},

ABSTRACT = {Forecasting future solar power plant production is essential to continue the development of photovoltaic energy and increase its share in the energy mix for a more sustainable future. Accurate solar radiation forecasting greatly improves the balance maintenance between energy supply and demand and grid management performance. This study assesses the influence of input selection on short-term global horizontal irradiance (GHI) forecasting across two contrasting Algerian climates: arid Ghardaïa and coastal Algiers. Eight feature selection methods (Pearson, Spearman, Mutual Information (MI), LASSO, SHAP (GB and RF), and RFE (GB and RF)) are evaluated using a Gradient Boosting model over horizons from one to six hours ahead. Input relevance depends on both the location and forecast horizon. At t+1, MI achieves the best results in Ghardaïa (nMAE = 6.44%), while LASSO performs best in Algiers (nMAE = 10.82%). At t+6, SHAP- and RFE-based methods yield the lowest errors in Ghardaïa (nMAE = 17.17%), and RFE-GB leads in Algiers (nMAE = 28.13%). Although performance gaps between methods remain moderate, relative improvements reach up to 30.28% in Ghardaïa and 12.86% in Algiers. These findings confirm that feature selection significantly enhances accuracy (especially at extended horizons) and suggest that simpler methods such as MI or LASSO can remain effective, depending on the climate context and forecast horizon.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) estimation is crucial for understanding land–atmosphere interactions, evaluating ecosystem functions, and supporting water resource management, particularly across climatically diverse regions. To address the limitations of traditional ET models, we propose a simple yet robust Sigmoid-RH model that characterizes the nonlinear relationship between relative humidity and ET. Unlike conventional approaches such as the Penman–Monteith or Priestley–Taylor models, the Sigmoid-RH model requires fewer inputs and is better suited for large-scale applications where data availability is limited. In this study, we applied the Sigmoid-RH model to estimate ET over mainland China from 2001 to 2018 by using satellite remote sensing and meteorological reanalysis data. Key driving inputs included air temperature (Ta), net radiation (Rn), relative humidity (RH), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), all of which are readily available from public datasets. Validation at 20 flux tower sites showed strong performance, with R-square (R2) ranging from 0.26 to 0.93, Root Mean Squard Error (RMSE) from 0.5 to 1.3 mm/day, and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) from 0.16 to 0.91. The model performed best in mixed forests (KGE = 0.90) and weakest in shrublands (KGE = 0.27). Spatially, ET shows a clear increasing trend from northwest to southeast, closely aligned with climatic zones, with national mean annual ET of 560 mm/yr, ranging from less than 200 mm/yr in arid zones to over 1100 mm/yr in the humid south. Seasonally, ET peaked in summer due to monsoonal rainfall and vegetation growth, and was lowest in winter. Temporally, ET declined from 2001 to 2009 but increased from 2009 to 2018, influenced by changes in precipitation and NDVI. These findings confirm the applicability of the Sigmoid-RH model and highlight the importance of hydrothermal conditions and vegetation dynamics in regulating ET. By improving the accuracy and scalability of ET estimation, this model can provide practical implications for drought early warning systems, forest ecosystem management, and agricultural irrigation planning under changing climate conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Flow regulation and water quality maintenance are considered ecosystem services, as they provide environmental benefits with a measurable economic value to society. Distributed or semi-distributed hydrological models can help identify where land use decisions yield the greatest economic and environmental returns related to water resources. For these reasons, this study integrated simulations performed with the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model under varying land use conditions, aiming to balance potential benefits with the loss of ecosystem services. Among the tested parameters, those associated with surface runoff showed the highest sensitivity in simulating streamflow for the Jundiaí River Basin. Based on the statistical indicators R2, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NS), and Percent Bias (PBIAS), the SWAT model demonstrated a reliable performance in replicating observed streamflows on a monthly scale, even with limited spatially distributed input data. Scenario 2, which involved converting 15% of pasture/agricultural land into forest, yielded the most favorable hydrological outcomes by increasing soil water infiltration and aquifer recharge while reducing surface runoff and sediment yield. These findings highlight the value of reforestation and land use planning as effective strategies for improving watershed hydrological performance and ensuring long-term water sustainability.},

ABSTRACT = {This study examines the complex interactions among soil moisture, evaporation, extreme weather events, and lightning, and their influence on fire activity across the extratropical and Pan-Arctic regions. Leveraging reanalysis and remote-sensing datasets from 2000 to 2020, we applied cross-correlation analysis, a modified Mann–Kendall trend test, and assessments of interannual variability to key variables including soil moisture, fire frequency and risk, evaporation, and lightning. Results indicate a significant increase in dry days (up to 40%) and heatwave events across Central Eurasia and Siberia (up to 50%) and Alaska (25%), when compared to the 1980–2000 baseline. Upward trends have been detected in evaporation across most of North America, consistent with soil moisture trends, while much of Eurasia exhibits declining soil moisture. Fire danger shows a strong positive correlation with evaporation north of 60° N (r ≈ 0.7, p ≤ 0.005), but a negative correlation in regions south of this latitude. These findings suggest that in mid-latitude ecosystems, fire activity is not solely driven by water stress or atmospheric dryness, highlighting the importance of region-specific surface–atmosphere interactions in shaping fire regimes. In North America, most fires occur in temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands (47%), whereas in Eurasia, approximately 55% of fires are concentrated in forests/taiga and temperate open biomes. The analysis also highlights that lightning-related fires are more prevalent in Eastern Europe and Southeastern Asia. In contrast, Western North America exhibits high fire incidence in temperate conifer forests despite relatively low lightning activity, indicating a dominant role of anthropogenic ignition. These findings underscore the importance of understanding land–atmosphere interactions in assessing fire risk. Integrating surface conditions, climate extremes, and ignition sources into fire prediction models is crucial for developing more effective wildfire prevention and management strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {Renewable energy stands as a pivotal solution to environmental concerns, prompting substantial research and development endeavors to promote its adoption and enhance energy efficiency. Despite the recognized environmental superiority of renewable energy systems, there is a lack of globally standardized indicators specifically focused on renewable energy efficiency. This study aims to develop and apply a non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) indicator, termed the Renewable Energy Indicator (REI), to measure environmental performance at the national level and to identify differences in renewable energy efficiency across countries grouped by development status and income level. The REI incorporates new factors such as agricultural methane emissions (thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalent), PM2.5 air pollution exposure (µg/m3), and aspects related to electricity, including consumption (as % of total final energy consumption), production from renewable sources, excluding hydroelectric (kWh), and accessibility in rural and urban areas (% of population with access), aligning with the emerging paradigm outlined by the United Nations. By segmenting the REI into global, developmental, and income group classifications, this study conducts the Mann–Whitney U test and the Kruskal–Wallis H tests to identify variations in renewable energy efficiency among different country groups. Our findings reveal top-performing countries globally, highlighting both developed (e.g., Sweden) and developing nations (e.g., Costa Rica, Sri Lanka). Central and North European countries demonstrate high efficiency, while those facing political and economic instability perform poorly. Agricultural-dependent nations like Australia and Argentina exhibit lower REI due to significant methane emissions. Disparities between developed and developing markets underscore the importance of understanding distinct socio-economic dynamics for effective policy formulation. Comparative analysis across income groups informs specific strategies tailored to each category.},

ABSTRACT = {Leaf phenology is key to ecosystem functioning by regulating carbon, water, and energy fluxes and influencing vegetation productivity. Yet, detecting land surface phenology (LSP) in drylands using remote sensing remains particularly challenging due to sparse and heterogeneous vegetation cover, high spatiotemporal variability, and complex spectral signals. Unlike the Northern Hemisphere, these challenges are further compounded in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), where several regions experience year-round moderate temperatures. When combined with irregular rainfall, this leads to highly variable vegetation activity throughout the year. However, LSP dynamics in the SH remain poorly understood. This study presents a review of remote sensing-based phenology research in drylands, integrating (i) a synthesis of global methodological advances and (ii) a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed studies published from 2015 through April 2025 focused on SH drylands. This review reveals a research landscape still dominated by conventional vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) and moderate-spatial-resolution sensors (e.g., MODIS), though a gradual shift toward higher-resolution sensors such as PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 has emerged since 2020. Despite the widespread use of start- and end-of-season metrics, their accuracy varies greatly, especially in heterogeneous landscapes. Yet, advanced products such as solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence or the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation were rarely employed. Gaps remain in the representation of hyperarid zones, grass- and shrub-dominated landscapes, and large regions of Africa and South America. Our findings highlight the need for multi-sensor approaches and expanded field validation to improve phenological assessments in dryland environments. The accurate differentiation of vegetation responses in LSP is essential not only for refining phenological metrics but also for enabling more realistic assessments of ecosystem functioning in the context of climate change and its impact on vegetation dynamics.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding the impacts of the spatial non-stationarity of environmental factors on surface soil moisture (SSM) in different seasons is crucial for effective environmental management. Yet, our knowledge of this phenomenon remains limited. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework that combines the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method with two-step clustering to unravel the spatial drivers of SSM across Iran. Due to the limited availability of in situ SSM data, the performance of three global SSM datasets—SMAP, MERRA-2, and CFSv2—from 2015 to 2023 was evaluated using agrometeorological stations. SMAP outperformed the others, showing the highest median correlation and the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Using SMAP, we estimated SSM across 609 catchments employing the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The RF model yielded R2 values of 0.89, 0.83, 0.70, and 0.75 for winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, with corresponding RMSE values of 0.076, 0.081, 0.098, and 0.061 m3/m3. SHAP analysis revealed that climatic factors primarily drive SSM in winter and autumn, while vegetation and soil characteristics are more influential in spring and summer. The clustering results showed that Iran’s catchments can be grouped into five categories based on the SHAP method coefficients, highlighting regional differences in SSM controls.},

ABSTRACT = {The agricultural sector faces significant sustainability, productivity, and environmental impact challenges. In this context, geographic information systems (GISs) have become a key tool to optimize resource management and make informed decisions based on spatial data. These data support planning the best cotton planting and harvest dates based on agroclimatic conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, and soil type, as well as identifying areas with a lower risk of water or thermal stress. As a result, cotton productivity is optimized, and costs associated with supplementary irrigation or losses due to adverse conditions are reduced. However, data from automatic weather stations in Mexico are scarce and incomplete. Instead, grid meteorological databases (DMM, in Spanish) were used with daily temperature and precipitation data from 1983 to 2020 to determine the heat units (HUs) for each cotton crop development stage; daily and accumulated HU; minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures; and mean annual precipitation. This information was used to determine areas that comply with environmental, geographic, and regulatory conditions (NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010, NOM-026-SAG/FITO-2014) to delimit areas with agricultural potential for planting genetically modified (GM) cotton. The methodology made it possible to produce thirty-four maps at a 1:250,000 scale and a digital GIS with 95% accuracy. These maps indicate whether a given agricultural parcel is optimal for cultivating GM cotton.},

ABSTRACT = {In response to the global imperative of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the optimisation of renewable energy systems under regionally favourable conditions has become increasingly essential. Solar irradiance forecasting plays a pivotal role in enhancing energy planning, grid reliability, and long-term sustainability. However, in the context of Turkey, existing studies on solar radiation forecasting often rely on traditional statistical approaches and are limited to single-site analyses, with insufficient attention to regional diversity and deep learning-based modelling. To address this gap, the present study focuses on Turkey’s Mediterranean region, characterised by high solar potential and diverse climatic conditions and strategically relevant to national clean energy targets. Historical data from 2020 to 2023 were used to forecast solar irradiance patterns up to 2026. Five representative locations—Adana, Isparta, Fethiye, Ulukışla, and Yüreğir—were selected to capture spatial and temporal variability across inland, coastal, and high-altitude zones. Advanced deep learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), were developed and evaluated using standard performance metrics. Among these, BiLSTM achieved the highest accuracy, with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.95, RMSE = 0.22, and MAPE = 5.4% in Fethiye, followed by strong performance in Yüreğir (R = 0.90, RMSE = 0.12, MAPE = 7.2%). These results demonstrate BiLSTM’s superior capacity to model temporal dependencies and regional variability in solar radiation. The findings contribute to the development of location-specific forecasting frameworks and offer valuable insights for renewable energy planning and grid integration in solar-rich environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Sustainable Development Reserves are organized units in the Amazon that are essential for the proper use and sustainable management of the region’s natural resources and for the livelihoods and economy of the local communities. This study aims to provide a climatic characterization of the Madeira River Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR), offering scientific support to efforts to assess the feasibility of implementing adaptation measures to increase the resilience of isolated Amazon communities in the face of extreme climate events. Significant statistical analyses based on time series of observational and reanalysis climate data were employed to obtain a detailed diagnosis of local climate variability. The results show that monthly mean two-meter temperatures vary from 26.5 °C in February, the coolest month, to 28 °C in August, the warmest month. Monthly precipitation averages approximately 250 mm during the rainy season, from December until May. July and August are the driest months, August and September are the warmest months, and September and October are the months with the lowest river level. Cold spells were identified in July, and warm spells were identified between July and September, making this period critical for public health. Heavy precipitation events detected by the R80, Rx1day, and Rx5days indices show an increasing trend in frequency and intensity in recent years. The analyses indicated that the MSDR has no potential for wind-energy generation; however, photovoltaic energy production is viable throughout the year. Regarding the two major commercial crops and their resilience to thermal stress, the region presents suitable conditions for açaí palm cultivation, but Brazil nut production may be adversely affected by extreme drought and heat events. The results of this study may support research on adaptation strategies that includethe preservation of local traditions and natural resources to ensure sustainable development.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the influence of inclination on a submerged plate (SP) device acting as both a breakwater (BW) and a wave energy converter (WEC) subjected to representative regular and realistic irregular waves of a sea state across 11 inclination angles. Numerical simulations were conducted using ANSYS Fluent. Regular waves were generated by Stokes’s second-order theory, while the WaveMIMO technique was employed to generate irregular waves. Using the volume of fluid (VOF) method to model the water–air interaction, both approaches generate waves by imposing their vertical and horizontal velocity components at the inlet of the wave flume. The SP’s performance as a BW was analyzed based on the upstream and downstream free surface elevations of the device; in turn, its performance as a WEC was determined through its axial velocity beneath the plate. The results indicate that performance varies between regular and irregular wave conditions, underscoring the importance of accurately characterizing the sea state at the intended installation site. These findings demonstrate that the inclination of the SP plays a critical role in balancing its dual functionality, with certain configurations enhancing WEC efficiency by over 50% while still offering relevant BW performance, even under realistic irregular sea conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {The concept of the circular economy aims to develop systems for reusing, recovering, and recycling products and services, pursuing both economic growth and sustainability. In many countries, legislation has been enacted to create frameworks ensuring environmental protection and fostering initiatives to implement the circular economy across various sectors. The wind energy industry is no exception, with industries and institutions adopting strategies to address the forthcoming challenge of repowering or dismantling a significant quantity of wind turbines in the coming years reaching a total of global wind power capacity by 2024. This also involves managing the resulting waste, which includes materials with high economic value as well as others that have considerable environmental impacts but that can be reused, recycled, or converted. In parallel, the research activity in this field has increased significantly in response to this challenge, leading to a vast body of work in the literature, especially in the last three years. The aim of this paper is to conduct a bibliometric study to provide a global perspective on the current literature in the field, covering the period from 2009 to 2024. A total of 670 publications were retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus, with 57% of them published in the last three years, highlighting the growing interest in the field. This study analyzes the research product, the most relevant journal, the most cited authors and institutions, their collaborative patterns, emerging trends, and gaps in the literature. This contribution will provide an up-to-date analysis of the field, fostering better understanding of the direction of the research and establishing a solid foundation for future studies},

ABSTRACT = {Τhe Greek Seas are one of the most favorable locations for offshore wind energy development in the Mediterranean basin. In 2023, the Hellenic Hydrocarbons & Energy Resources Management Company SA published the draft National Offshore Wind Farm Development Programme (NDP-OWF), including the main pillars for the design, development, siting, installation, and exploitation of offshore wind farms, along with the Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment. The NDP-OWF is under assessment by the relevant authorities and is expected to be finally approved through a Joint Ministerial Decision. In this work, the preliminary offshore wind energy assessment of the Greek Seas is performed using the CERRA wind reanalysis data and in situ measurements from six offshore locations of the Greek Seas. The in situ measurements are used in order to assess the performance of the reanalysis datasets. The results reveal that CERRA is a reliable source for preliminary offshore wind energy assessment studies. Taking into consideration the potential offshore wind farm organized development areas (OWFODA) according to the NDP-OWF, the study of the local wind characteristics is performed. The local wind speed and wind power density are assessed, and the wind energy produced from each OWFODA is estimated based on three different capacity density settings. According to the balanced setting (capacity density of 5.0 MW/km2), the annual energy production will be 17.5 TWh, which is equivalent to 1509.1 ktoe. An analysis of the wind energy correlation, synergy, and complementarity between the OWFODA is also performed, and a high degree of wind energy synergy is identified, with a very low degree of complementarity.},

ABSTRACT = {Electric buses (EBs) are increasingly adopted for their environmental and operational benefits, yet their real-world efficiency is influenced by climate, route characteristics, and auxiliary energy demands. While most existing research identifies winter as the most energy-intensive season due to cabin heating and reduced battery performance, this study presents a contrasting perspective based on a three-year longitudinal analysis of the LYMMO fleet in Orlando, Florida—a subtropical U.S. region. The findings reveal that summer is the most energy-intensive season, primarily due to sustained HVAC usage driven by high ambient temperatures—a seasonal pattern rarely reported in the current literature and a key regional contribution. Additionally, idling time exceeds driving time across all seasons, with HVAC usage during idling emerging as the dominant contributor to total energy consumption. To mitigate these inefficiencies, a proxy-based HVAC energy estimation method and an optimization model were developed, incorporating ambient temperature and peak passenger load. This approach achieved up to 24% energy savings without compromising thermal comfort. Results validated through non-parametric statistical testing support operational strategies such as idling reduction, HVAC control, and seasonally adaptive scheduling, offering practical pathways to improve EB efficiency in warm-weather transit systems.},
