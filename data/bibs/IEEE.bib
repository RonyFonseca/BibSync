  abstract={Summary <p>Photovoltaic (PV) is the collective name for devices that directly convert sunlight into electricity. This chapter explores some famous types of solar cells. The first generation solar cells are also known as silicon wafer&#x2010;based solar cells. The second generation of PV materials is based on the use of thin film deposits of semiconductors. Third generation solar cells are very different because of the use of innovative semiconductors. There are several technologies in the third generation, which includes photoelectrochemical cells, nanocrystal solar cells, and dye&#x2010;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Fourth generation solar cells use composite PV technology. The chapter presents a detailed illustration on DSSCs and their applications. DSSCs are the most prominent third generation solar cells, exhibiting several features that are not available in any other types of solar cell. The photoelectrode and counter electrode (CE) of standard DSSCs are prepared on a transparent conducting glass substrate. The photoelectrode is a key component in the DSSC.</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>This chapter begins by listing the advantages of dye&#x2010;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). It also summarizes their five major components: conductive and transparent glasses; nanocrystalline semiconductor film; dye sensitizer; redox couple; and counterelectrode. Among these, the sensitizer is one of the key components in achieving high efficiency. Many type of metal complexes and metal&#x2010;free organic dyes can be used in DSSC fabrication. However, the major drawback of using a single sensitizer is failure to harness photons either from visible or near infrared (NIR) region. In this regard, cosensitization is found to be alternative method. The chapter focuses on the relationship between a structural property of metal&#x2010;free organic dyes with metal complexes and in between two metal&#x2010;free organic dyes under cosensitization. It further discusses the relationship between the molecular design and photovoltaic performances of DSSCs to develop new directions in achieving high efficiency for DSSCs.</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>The most commonly known renewable energy sources include the wind, wave, hydroelectric, biomass, and solar energy. Photovoltaic cells are divided into three main categories and referred to as generations of photovoltaic cells. The first generation of photovoltaic includes the monocrystalline silicon and multicrystalline silicon based solar cells. The second generation solar cells include amorphous silicon&#x2010;based thin film solar cells &#x2010; cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS) solar cells and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) solar cells. In third generation solar cells, the electrolyte plays a vital role in deciding the power conversion efficiency as well as stability. Liquid electrolytes are the conventional type of electrolyte and the most widely used transport medium. Polymer electrolytes are ionic conductors prepared by the dissolution of salts in a suitable polymer. Polymer electrolytes are divided into solid polymer electrolyte (SPE), gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) and composite polymer electrolyte (CPE).</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>This chapter examines recent advancement in screening strategies in the selecting the counter electrode (CE) materials in an efficient solar energy conversion system. It discusses the electrocatalytic activity of efficient nonplatinum CE materials for solar cell applications. This CE material contains carbon&#x2010;based materials, polymers, metal sulfides, metal nitrides and carbides, and composites materials. The chapter discusses various efficient CE materials established via the convenient manufacturing procedure. It also discusses the role of the nanocomposite materials for dye&#x2010;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), and perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Carbonaceous materials have been verified to be an appropriate material to replace the platinum CE in solar cells. Transition metal nitrides and carbides, termed interstitial compounds, have a tendency to imitate platinum&#x2010;like catalytic behavior. Composite materials usually comprising two or more component, which combine the benefits of each constituent into one, have been extensively recognized as effective CEs in DSSCs.</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>This chapter explains the importance of the solar cells. Solar cells have come a long way and dye&#x2010;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a third generation photovoltaic system. The first generation is the silicon solar cell and the second generation is the thin film technology. Although the price of the first generation solar cell has reduced, the emerging third generation technology promises to be less expensive. The advantage of the DSSC is that it is still functional in diffused light at intensities less than 1 Sun. Next, the chapter describes the structure and working principle of DSSCs with gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs). It further focuses on the GPEs for application in DSSCs. The chapter argues that redox couple should be included in the GPE for DSSC applications. Finally, it elaborates the choice and role of other constituents in DSSCs.</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>Organic solar cells (OSC) based on solution&#x2010;processed semiconducting polymers have been a hot topic of research since the 1980s. Organic solar cells present several advantages over conventional inorganic counterparts: lightweight, flexibility, semi&#x2010;transparent, easy color&#x2010;tuning, positive temperature coefficient, low energy intensive fabrication protocols, and sensitivity to low&#x2010;light condition. This chapter focuses mainly on the stability aspect of the OSC. It presents the fundamentals, advantages, and properties of inverted organic solar cells (IOSCs). The chapter outlines a summary of recent developments using various charge transport layers. It discusses two unique inherent issues of IOSC that is wettability and light&#x2010;soaking issues. The chapter illustrates the strategies to overcome such issues by adopting electron and hole transport layer modifications to produce a solution&#x2010;processed, light&#x2010;soaking free IOSC by using specific examples. It also presents the versatility of such solution&#x2010;processed, light&#x2010;soaking free devices using a different photoactive layer, such as low bandgap polymer and small molecule based photoactive layers.</p>},

China is actively promoting Integrative Solar Architecture, solar heating and solar hot water systems are important part. In China, solar radiation is large in summer and only solar water heating needed, solar collector area need small. In winter, both solar hot water and solar heating needed, but the solar radiation is smaller, so the solar collector areas have multiplied. The relevant norms and the manual give the methods for calculation solar collector areas for solar heating and solar water heating used alone. But they did not give the method of how to calculation the solar collector areas when the solar hot water and solar heating used at the same time.

  abstract={Summary <p>This chapter updates the progress made in materials and novel design in the device structure for the improved photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). The conjugated polymers became a prime constituent in organic electronics. Since conjugated polymers are solution&#x2010;processable, they can be coated by spin coating, inkjet printing, roller casting and so on. All&#x2010;polymer solar cells also have the same device configurations as conventional PSCs. Devices made of materials having both donor (p&#x2010;type) and acceptor (n&#x2010;type) represent the most efficient configuration to realize organic photovoltaic cells with high power conversion efficiency. The device architecture of the photoactive layer has a strong impact on charge carrier separation and transport, and, therefore, plays a major role in improving the efficiency. Tandem structure in PSCs has been introduced to increase light absorption. The performance of inverted PSCs is predominantly influenced by the optical transparency and electrical conductivity of the electron transport layers.</p>},

  abstract={Determining the optimal position of the solar collectors is essential for the maximum benefit of solar energy received by the solar panels and facilities including large sizes such as concentrated solar energy systems or large-scale solar photovoltaic installations. In this paper we study the optimal position for solar sensors located in Beirut (33.89; 35.50) in 3 configurations: constant optimal angle; Monthly variable tilt angle; and solar sensors with a tracking system of the solar race. After validating the numerical model comparing it to a weather file data for normal, diffused, and global horizontal average hourly solar radiation per month; optimization was made to determine the optimal position of solar collectors according the Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG2) Algorithm which is normally used for optimizing nonlinear problems. The results show that the optimum angle of inclination for the city of Beirut is close to 30° (27.9°). By varying this angle monthly (i.e. through an adjustable tilt chassis), a 6% increase of collected energy is obtained compared to a constant optimal angle. As for the system, it has great interest as it allows an increase of 37% of solar energy compared to a constant optimal angle. The method adopted is of great interest since it could be applied to any region, not just in Beirut by changing the latitude parameter and the clearness index for the site concerned.},

  abstract={The air quality in Bangladesh is characterized by significantly higher levels of dust compared to many developed nations, with various anthropogenic sources contributing to this pollution. Despite its significant impact on public health and the environment, there are limited measures in place to address dust emissions. This study examines the long-term dust levels in urban regions of Bangladesh, highlighting the excessive presence of PM10 particles. A novel aspect of this work lies in the integration of both dust and solar radiation data to assess the feasibility of solar power plant locations in the country. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting sites with minimal dust sources nearby, such as those distanced from major industrial zones, brick kilns, and large-scale construction sites. Additionally, it proposes that regional air quality be considered as a critical parameter in environmental impact assessments for new developments. The Government of Bangladesh's (GOB) 2025 Renewable Energy (RE) policy places substantial focus on solar energy, making this analysis timely and relevant. The research evaluates six locations—Dhaka, Barisal, Rangpur, Chittagong, Sylhet, and Rajshahi—based on the annual average PM10 dust concentration and solar radiation levels from 2015 to 2024. The results indicate that solar radiation ranged from 147.667 to $441 \text{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$, while PM10 concentrations varied between 106.1 and $153.8 ~ \mu ~\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$. This work identifies optimal sites for solar photovoltaic (PV) installations in Bangladesh, addressing the dual challenges of dust pollution and solar irradiance, and offers novel insights for sustainable solar energy deployment.},

  abstract={In this paper a calculation method is shown to estimate the yearly incoming solar radiation. In Hungary there is a static method to calculate the solar heat gain however this method is not suitable for low energy or nearly zero energy buildings because the relevance of solar heat gain grows bigger by the thermal envelope's increasing thermal resistance. It is necessary to develop a more accurate calculating method. In this paper the solar heat gain calculation is based on geometrical and intensity calculations so a more accurate method is used to determine the solar heat radiation. By knowing the incoming solar radiation it is possible to calculate a building's yearly solar energy gain. In the case of low energy or nearly zero energy buildings the heat gain in the heating period should be maximized and in the summer period it must be minimized.},
